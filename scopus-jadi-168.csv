These interactions are often complex. Thus, interactions that an individual has with other individuals, to some extent, influence the decisions they make. There have been many efforts to uncover, explore, and measure the concept of social influence. Thus, modeling influence is an open and challenging problem where most evaluation models focus on online social networks. However, they fail to characterize some properties of social influence. To address the limitations of the previous approaches, we propose a novel Probabilistic Reasoning system for social INfluence analysis (PRIN) to examine the social influence process and elucidate the factors that affect it in an attempt to explain this phenomenon. In this paper, we present a model that quantitatively measures social influence in online social networks. Experiments on a real social network such as Twitter demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms traditional feature engineering-based approaches. This suggests the effectiveness of this novel model when modeling and predicting social influence. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."",""Bayesian network"; Social influence analysis;" Social networks"",""Probabilistic logics"; Social networking (online); Daily lives; Evaluation models; Feature engineerings; On-line social networks; Probabilistic reasoning; Social influence;" Economic and social effects"",""Vega, L."; Research Center for Advanced Study from the National Polytechnic InstituteMexico;" email: lea.vegar@cinvestav.mx"",,""Springer"",18695450,,,,""English"",""Soc.

Prominent use cases include marketing campaigns for products or political candidates in which maximizing the expected number of reached individuals is a common objective. The latter can be achieved by incentivizing an appropriately selected seed set of influencers that trigger an influence cascade with expected maximum impact. In real-world settings, competing influence spreads need to be considered frequently. These may, for instance, stem from marketing activities for a substitute product of a different company or bad actors that spread (mis-)information about a political candidate. This article focuses on competitive settings in which the seed individuals of one entity are already known. Another entity wants to choose its seed set of individuals that triggers an influence cascade of maximum impact. The propagation process is modeled by a variant of the probabilistic independent cascade model. An algorithmic framework based on a Benders decomposition is developed that also employs preprocessing and initial heuristics. This framework is used within a sample average approximation scheme that allows to approximate the exact objective function value. The algorithms are tested on real-world instances from the literature and newly-obtained ones from Twitter. A computational study reports on the algorithms’ performance next to providing further insights. The latter are based on analyzing expected losses that are caused by competition, the gain from solving subproblems to optimality using the Benders decomposition based algorithm, and the influence of different seed set choices of the first entity. © 2020 The Authors"",""Benders decomposition"; Competitive influence maximization; Integer linear programming;" Social networks"",""adult"; algorithm; article; competition; decomposition; heuristics; human; marketing; misinformation; online social network; seed set;" system analysis"",""Kahr, M."; University of Vienna, Austria;" email: m.kahr@univie.ac.at"",,""Elsevier Ltd"",03050483,,OMEGA,,""English"",""Omega"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Hybrid Gold"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084038338";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Twitter allows users to make use of hashtags to facilitate effective categorization and retrieval of tweets. Despite the usefulness of hashtags, a major fraction of tweets do not contain hashtags. Several methods have been proposed to recommend hashtags based on lexical and topical features of tweets. However, semantic features and data sparsity in tweet representation have rarely been addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we propose a novel method for hashtag recommendation that resolves the data sparseness problem by exploiting the most relevant tweet information from external knowledge sources. In addition to lexical features and topical features, the proposed method incorporates the semantic features based on word-embeddings and user influence feature based on users’ influential position. To gain the advantage of various hashtag recommendation methods based on different features, our proposed method aggregates these methods using learning-to-rank and generates top-ranked hashtags. Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."",""Hashtag recommendation"; Information extraction and filtering; Semantic knowledge bases;" Social media analysis"",,""Kumar, N."; Indian Institute of Technology IndoreIndia;" email: nagendra@iiti.ac.in"",,""Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH"",02191377,,,,""English"",""Knowl.

By using a sample of over 4.5 million tweets, we applied a social networks approach to examine whether and, if so, how different types of users influence online engagement and patterns of information flow of professional football clubs on Twitter. We focus on five types of social mediators (i.e., key users who connect organizations with their publics): (1) organizational (e.g., teams or players), (2) industry (e.g., competitors or associations), (3) media (e.g., journalists), (4) individual (e.g., fans), and (5) celebrities. Our results indicate that the power of media social mediators—the most traditional mediators—has declined over recent years, and they were negatively associated with engagement on Twitter. Instead, relationships between football clubs and publics were primarily mediated by individual social mediators, for top division clubs in particular. Taken together, scholars and practitioners should recognize the potential impact of social mediators, given that even individuals can function as powerful users in the information diffusion process. © The Author(s) 2019."",""social media"; social mediators; social network analysis; sports organizations;" Twitter"",,""Vermeer, S.A.M."; Amsterdam School of Communication Research (ASCoR), Netherlands;" email: s.a.m.vermeer@uva.nl"",,""SAGE Publications Ltd"",21674795,,,,""English"",""Commun.

We measure the significant traffic of tweets only, by implementing an entropy-based null model that discounts the activity of users and the virality of tweets. Results show that social bots play a central role in the exchange of significant content.

This paper proposes two models for social influence estimation, namely Time Decay Features Cascade Model (TDF-C) and Time Decay Features Cascade Threshold Model (TDF-CT). These models overcome three main existing challenges - first, measure the strength of user's influence as an influencer"; second, identify the set of users influenced by an influencer;" third, estimate the time frame of the influence. TDF-C is an M-TAP based diffusion model, which learns influence probabilities between users using four types of features, namely temporal, interaction, structural, and profile features, and uses Independent Cascade (IC) model for influence estimation. TDF-CT is an extension of the TDF-C model, which uses temporal and interaction features to calculate the diffusion through the Progressive Feedback Estimation (PFE) model in place of IC model. PFE model is a fusion of two diffusion models, i.e., Linear Threshold (LT) and Independent Cascade. TDF-CT handles the limitations of the contemporary diffusion models, i.e., IC and LT. The efficacy of proposed models is evaluated with respect to existing models Independent Cascade (IC), Time Constant Cascade (TC-C), Time Decay Cascade (TD-C), and Time-Depth Decay Cascade (TDD-C). Experimental evaluation over two benchmark datasets namely Darwin and MelCup17 reveal that proposed models are able to make the predictions very close to the real-time in a given time frame. TDF-CT and TDF-C are most suitable for applications requiring high precision and high recall, respectively. Results of spread shape establish the efficacy of models to spread the influence with good coverage of the social network.

Based on stakeholder theory, this study aims to fill this gap by analyzing Women Who Code (WWC)'s tweets to examine whether there are any differences in the number of retweets with respect to the content categories (information, community or action) and features (hashtags, emojis, photos, videos and URLs) in its Twitter communications. Design/methodology/approach: WWC's original tweets that were posted during a one-year period from February 20, 2018 to February 20, 2019 were collected using a Twitter analytics tool. The content categories for each tweet were coded, and the number of hashtags and emojis used and the inclusion of photos, videos and URLs were noted. A negative binomial regression model was used to address the research questions. Findings: The findings showed that with respect to the content categories, community and action-based tweets were retweeted less frequently than informational tweets. With respect to the content features, the results showed that using emojis or URLs in a tweet affected retweets positively, while including hashtags or a video affected them negatively. Further, using photos or images in a tweet had no significant effect on retweets. Originality/value: These findings contribute to our understanding of non-profit organizations' use of Twitter and provide practical implications for the way non-profit organizations that target female audiences interested in technology can disseminate their messages more strategically. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Communication strategy"; Non-profit sector; Social media;" Strategic communication"",,""Chung, A."; Communication and Journalism, United States;" email: ezc0033@auburn.edu"",,""Emerald Group Holdings Ltd."",1363254X,,,,""English"",""J.

The importance of this analysis stems from the fact that such users can affect their followers “/friends” viewpoints. This study aims at introducing two new indices to identify the most influential users in the Twitter social network. Four sets of features extracted from user activities, user profile, tweets, and actions performed on tweets are deployed to create the proposed indices. The available methods of detecting the most influential Twitterers either consider a limited set of features or do not accurately measure the effect of each feature. The indices proposed in this paper consider a comprehensive set of features and also provide a time-sensitive rank which can be used to measure the dynamic nature of influence. Moreover, the relative impact of each feature is computed and considered in the indices. We employ the indices to discover the influential Twitter users posting on Paris attacks in 2015, in a comprehensive analysis. The influence trend of users’ tweets in a 21-day period discloses that 76% of the users do not succeed in posting a second influential tweet. Results reveal that the proposed indices can detect both the publicly recognized sources (like celebrities) and also the less known individuals which gain credit by posting several influential tweets after a specific event. We further compare the proposed indices with other available approaches. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature."",""AHP"; Influential Twitter users; Knowledge discovery; Social network analysis;" Time-sensitive ranking"",,""Mashayekhi, H."; Faculty of Computer Engineering, Iran;" email: hmashayekhi@shahroout.ac.ir"",,""Springer"",02191377,,,,""English"",""Knowl.

Analysing such network can be leveraged by harnessing rich semantic meaning of scholarly graph. Identifying and ranking top-k influential nodes from various domains of scholarly literature using social media data are still infancy. Social networking sites like Twitter provide an opportunity to create inventive graph-based measures to identify and rank influential nodes such as scholars, articles, journal, information spreading media and academic institutions of scholarly literature. Many network-based models such as centrality measures have been proposed to identify influential nodes. The empirical annotation shows that centrality measures for finding influential nodes are high in computational complexity. In addition, notion of these measures have high variance, which signifies an influential node deviation with change in application and nature of information flows in the network. The research aims to propose an ensemble learning approach based on multimodal majority voting influence (MMMVI) to identify and weighted multimodal ensemble average influence (WMMEAI) to rank top-k influential nodes in Twitter network data set of well-known three influential nodes, that is, academic institution, scholar and journal. The empirical analysis has been accomplished to learn practicability and efficiency of the proposed approaches when compared with state-of-the-art approaches.

The users can not only keep in touch with family and friends, but also send and share the instant information. However, in some practical scenarios, we need to take effective measures to control the negative information spreading, e.g., rumors spread over the networks. In this paper, we first propose the minimizing influence of rumors (MIR) problem, i.e., selecting a blocker set B with k nodes such that the users' total activation probability by rumor source set S is minimized. Then, we employ the classical independent cascade (IC) model as an information diffusion model. Based on the IC model, we prove that the objective function is monotone decreasing and non-submodular. To address the MIR problem effectively, we propose a two-stages method generating candidate set and selecting blockers for the general networks. Furthermore, we also study the MIR problem on the tree network and propose a dynamic programming guaranteeing the optimal solution. Finally, we evaluate proposed algorithms by simulations on synthetic and real-life social networks, respectively.

Retweeting or resharing nature has made Twitter a popular medium of information dissemination. The purpose of this article is to enhance our understanding of both linguistic style and content properties (i.e. both affective and informational contents) that drives resharing behavior or virality of disaster messages on Twitter. We investigate this issue in the context of natural disaster crisis. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the authors develop, drawing upon language expectancy and uncertainty reduction theories as an enabling framework, hypotheses about how the language (i.e. style and content) influence resharing behavior. They employ a natural language processing of disaster tweets to examine how the language – linguistic style (concrete and interactive language) and linguistic content (information- and affect-focused language) – affects resharing behavior on Twitter during natural disasters. To examine the effects of both linguistic style and content factors on virality, a series of negative binomial regressions were conducted, particularly owing to the highly skewed count data. Findings: Our analysis of tweets from the 2013 Colorado floods shows that resharing disasters tweets increases with the use of concrete language style during acute emergencies. Interactive language is also positively associated with retweet frequency. In addition, neither positive nor negative emotional tweets drive down resharing during acute crises, while information-focused language content has a significantly positive effect on virality. Practical implications: Agencies for public safety and disaster management or volunteer organizations involved in disseminating crisis and risk information to the public may leverage the impacts of the linguistic style and language content through the lens of our research model. The findings encourage practitioners to focus on the role of linguistic style cues during acute disasters. Specifically, from the uncertainty reduction perspective, using concrete language in the disaster tweets is the expected norm, leading to a higher likelihood of virality. Also, interactively frame disaster tweets are more likely to be diffused to a larger number of people on Twitter. Originality/value: The language that people use offer important psychological cue to their intentions and motivations. However, the role of language on Twitter has largely been ignored in this crisis communication and few prior studies have examined the relationship between language and virality during acute emergencies. This article explains the complex and multifaceted nature of information resharing behavior using a multi-theoretical approach – including uncertainty reduction and language expectancy theory – to understand effects of language style and content cues on resharing behavior in the context of natural crisis events. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited."",""Disaster tweet"; Information diffusion; Language expectancy theory; Linguistic style;" Uncertainty reduction"",""Digital storage"; Disaster prevention; Information dissemination; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Social networking (online); Crisis communications; Design/methodology/approach; Disaster management; NAtural language processing; Negative binomial regression; Theoretical approach; Uncertainty reduction; Uncertainty reduction theory;" Disasters"",""Lee, C.H."; College of Business and Economics, United Arab Emirates;" email: changlee@uaeu.ac.ae"",,""Emerald Group Publishing Ltd."",02635577,,IMDSD,,""English"",""Ind Manage Data Sys"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087137000";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In particular, this paper investigates the influence of two types of users: crowd (regular users) and hubs (users with a large number of followers) on the speed and magnitude of information propagation. Effective and efficient disaster response requires rapid dissemination of situational information to improve situation awareness, save lives, and quickly repair damages. The use of social media, such as Twitter, has gained popularity for spreading the situational information in disasters. Little is known, however, regarding the underlying diffusion mechanisms influencing the speed and magnitude of spreading disaster-related information on social media. To address this gap, using tweets related to Hurricane Harvey, this study examined the role of hubs and crowd and the influence of different features such as theme, hashtag, media, users’ location, and the intervention timing of online users on the speed and magnitude of information spread. The results compare the differences in the speed and magnitude of information spread between two diffusion patterns: crowd diffusion (less than 2% retweets from hubs) and mixed diffusion (more than 2% retweets from hubs). The findings suggest that both diffusion patterns can achieve high speed and high magnitude in terms of information diffusion for trending tweets with different features. For mixed diffusion, the speed and magnitude of the tweets are governed by the activities of hubs. The results also show that early intervention of hubs increases the speed of information propagation. Also, in the crowd diffusion, information spread is influenced by both crowd and hubs whose retweets cause tipping points in the information diffusion process at different points of time. The findings imply intervention strategies to better disseminate situational information in disasters. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"",""Crowd"; Disasters; Hubs; Information diffusion;" Online social networks"",,""Fan, C."; Zachry Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, 400 Bizzell St., United States;" email: chfan@tamu.edu"",,""Elsevier Ltd"",22124209,,,,""English"",""Int.

Research on virality is of primarily two types. Content-based research focuses on how content characteristics influence virality, whereas creator-based research uses characteristics of the creator of the content to study virality. Through this research note, we aim to draw attention toward a relatively ignored set of constructs—the interactions between content characteristics and creator characteristics. We propose a typology of content features and content message on one hand and creator features and creator history on the other. We argue that adding nuanced content–creator interactions to the nomological network for virality will add conceptual richness and improve predictive validity of future studies. We demonstrate this by running models, with and without the interactions, on a data set of nearly 800,000 posts from Twitter. We find that many of these interactions are significant, improve goodness of fit by 20%, provide clues about contextual factors in virality, and boost predictive power by 12%. Our results and subsequent discussions of the findings hope to spur more research on content–creator interactions in understanding virality.

One of the key research is influence maximization (IM). IM is a problem to find a seed set with k nodes, so as to maximize the range of information propagation in OSNs. Most research adopts general greedy, degree discount, and centrality measures, etc. to find the seed node set. However, the time sensitivity is ignored in terms of propagation delay and duration under some specific situations such as emergent epidemiological bulletins and natural disaster warning. In the meantime, prior studies have mainly based on static network topology, but the user’s online/offline status and the topic preference of interaction make it difficult for traditional methods to be applied well in reality. Considering the above analysis, in this paper, we focus on the problem of time-sensitive influence maximization and give its formal description. Here, a dynamic network is constructed in terms of users’ online status. To solve the problem, we propose a topic based time-sensitive dynamic propagation model considering user topic preference and interaction delay. Besides, two algorithms are used in our work to find a seed set that could maximize the influence in OSNs with the time constraint, namely topic-based time-sensitive greedy algorithm (TTG) and topic-based time-sensitive heuristic algorithm (TTH), respectively. Extensive experiments on Twitter dataset demonstrate the efficiency and influence performance of the proposed algorithms on evaluation metrics. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."",""Dynamic propagation model"; Influence Maximization; OSNs; Time sensitivity;" Topic preference"",""Crack propagation"; Disasters; Heuristic algorithms; Information dissemination; Dynamic propagation; Influence maximizations; OSNs; Time sensitivity; Topic preferences;" Social networking (online)"",""Cao, J."; School of Computer Science and Engineering, China;" email: jx.cao@seu.edu.cn"",,""Springer"",1386145X,,,,""English"",""World Wide Web"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082947341";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Due to the unprecedented scale and the cascading power of the underlying social networks, social media has created a new paradigm for sharing information, broadcasting breaking news, and reporting real-time events by any user from anywhere at any time. Many popular social media sites including Twitter provide streaming data services by standard APIs to the broad researcher and developer communities. Given the sheer data volume, rapid velocity, and feature variety of online social media, these sites often supply only a sampled set of streaming data, rather than the full data set to reduce the resource cost of computations, storage, and network bandwidth. In light of the substantial impact of sampling in Twitter data stream, this article explores a combination of spectral clustering, locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling, and differential equation modeling to mitigate the impact of sampling on social media data analysis, in particular on detecting real-world events and predicting information diffusion. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method is able to detect effectively the real-time emerging events and predict accurately the cascading pattern of these events from the 1% sampled Twitter data stream.

Social networks can even accommodate sharing of live streaming data among the connected users. However, social information on social networks is often locally exploited rather than capturing the changes in the entire network over time. Obtaining user's influence statistics is limited only in their local vicinity, which may not facilitate capturing the changes in the user and post influences across the entire network, thereby resulting in lower accuracy while measuring user's topical influence. Moreover, low-influence users always exist in the network publishing low-quality posts. With the objectives of accurately capturing highly influential users and posts, this article proposes a novel dynamic social sensing model, named dynamic PageRank (DPRank) model, to evaluate the dynamic topical influence of the users of social information on social networks during the social information evolution. We deploy our proposed model to real-world Twitter data sets, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model against notable existing methods while identifying the true influence of users and posts in a dynamically evolving social network. © 2014 IEEE."",""Dynamic post influence"; dynamic user influence; PageRank;" social sensing"",""Social aspects"; Online social networks (OSNs); PageRank; Sharing information; Social information; Social media datum; Social relationships; Social sensing; User influences;" Social networking (online)"",""Liu, L."; School of Informatics, United Kingdom;" email: l.liu@leicester.ac.uk"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",2329924X,,,,""English"",""IEEE Trans.

This is done using social network analysis and semantic analysis. The proposed method (1) detects and removes fake supporter(s), (2) mines communities in the politicians' social network(s), (3) investigates the supporters' reply network for conversations between supporters about each leader, and, finally, (4) analyses the retweet network for information diffusion of each political leader. Furthermore, sentiment analysis of the supporters of politicians is done using machine learning techniques, which ultimately predicted and revealed the strongest supporter network(s) among the three political leaders. Analysis of this data reveals that as of October 2017 (1) IK was the most renowned of the three politicians and had the strongest supporter's community while using Twitter in avery controlled manner, (2) BBZ had the weakest supporters' network on Twitter, and (3) the supporters of the political leaders in Pakistan are flexible on Twitter, communicating with each other, and that any group of supporters has a low level of isolation. © 2020 Asif Khan et al."",,""Decision making"; Learning systems; Semantic Web; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Information diffusion; Machine learning techniques; Micro-blogging platforms; Pakistan; Semantic analysis; Social media networks;" Social networking (online)"",""Zhang, H."; School of Computer Science and Technology, China;" email: kevinzhang@bit.edu.cn"",,""Hindawi Limited"",10589244,,SCIPE,,""English"",""Sci.

The proposed approach aims to detect trending topic influencers. Firstly, communication relationships namely retweet, mention, and reply between users in a trending topic are extracted and a trending topic graph is constructed.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of measuring time-sensitive and topic-specific influence based on streaming texts and dynamic social networks. A user's influence can change rapidly in response to a new event and vary on different topics. For example, the political influence of Douglas Jones increased dramatically after winning the Alabama special election, and then rapidly decreased after the election week. During the same period, however, Douglas Jones' influence on sports remained low. Most existing approaches can only model the influence based on static social network structures and topic distributions. Furthermore, as popular social networking services embody many features to connect their users, multi-Typed interactions make it hard to learn the roles that different interactions play when propagating information. To address these challenges, we propose a Time-sensitive and Topic-specific Influence Measurement (TTIM) method, to jointly model the streaming texts and dynamic social networks. We simulate the influence propagation process with a self-Attention mechanism to learn the contributions of different interactions and track the influence dynamics with a matrix-Adaptive long short-Term memory. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to measure time-sensitive and topic-specific influence. Furthermore, the TTIM model can be easily adapted to supporting online learning which consumes constant training time on newly arrived data for each timestamp.

This awareness can be better understood by studying the spread, structure and evolution of software vulnerability discussions across online communities. This work is the first to evaluate and contrast how discussions about software vulnerabilities spread on three social platforms- Twitter, GitHub, and Reddit. Moreover, we measure how user-level e.g., bot or not, and content-level characteristics e.g., vulnerability severity, post subjectivity, targeted operating systems as well as social network topology influence the rate of vulnerability discussion spread. To lay the groundwork, we present a novel fundamental framework for measuring information spread in multiple social platforms that identifies spread mechanisms and observables, units of information, and groups of measurements. We then contrast topologies for three social networks and analyze the effect of the network structure on the way discussions about vulnerabilities spread. We measure the scale and speed of the discussion spread to understand how far and how wide they go, how many users participate, and the duration of their spread. To demonstrate the awareness of more impactful vulnerabilities, a subset of our analysis focuses on vulnerabilities targeted during recent major cyber-attacks and those exploited by advanced persistent threat groups. One of our major findings is that most discussions start on GitHub not only before Twitter and Reddit, but even before a vulnerability is officially published. The severity of a vulnerability contributes to how much it spreads, especially on Twitter. Highly severe vulnerabilities have significantly deeper, broader and more viral discussion threads. When analyzing vulnerabilities in software products we found that different flavors of Linux received the highest discussion volume. We also observe that Twitter discussions started by humans have larger size, breadth, depth, adoption rate, lifetime, and structural virality compared to those started by bots. On Reddit, discussion threads of positive posts are larger, wider, and deeper than negative or neutral posts. We also found that all three networks have high modularity that encourages spread. However, the spread on GitHub is different from other networks, because GitHub is more dense, has stronger community structure and assortativity that enhances information diffusion. We anticipate the results of our analysis to not only increase the understanding of software vulnerability awareness but also inform the existing and new analytical frameworks for simulating information spread e.g., disinformation across multiple social environments online. © 2020 Shrestha et al.

Using data from over 9.5 million tweets posted during and shortly after four key debates leading up to the 2016 U.S. presidential election, the authors test a series of hypotheses about how tweeting evolves over time during such events. They find that (1) as the debates progressed, the content of the “Twittersphere” became increasingly decoupled from the live event, and (2) the drivers of the success of tweets during the debates differed from the drivers of success observed after the debates. During the debates, users acted akin to narrators, posting shorter tweets that commented on unfolding events, with linguistic emotionality playing a limited role in sharing. However, when the debates were over, users acted more like interpreters, with successful posts being more elaborate and visually and emotionally rich accounts of the event.

Hence, the conventional epidemiological models fail to capture the heterogeneity of social networks and the complexity of information diffusion. Standard information diffusion models depend heavily on the micro-level parameters of the network like edge weights and implicit vulnerabilities of nodes towards information. Such parameters are rarely available because of the absence of large amounts of information diffusion data. Hence, modeling information diffusion remains a challenging research problem. In this paper, we utilize the peculiar structure of the real-world social networks to derive useful insights into the micro-level parameters. We propose an artificial framework mimicking the real-world information diffusion. The framework includes (1) a synthetic network which structurally resembles a real-world social network and (2) a meme spreading model based on the penta-level classification of edges in the network. The experimental results prove that the synthetic network combined with the proposed spreading model is able to simulate a real-world meme diffusion. The framework is validated with the help of the diffusion data of the Higgs boson meme on Twitter and the datasets of several popular real-world social networks. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature."",""Community structure"; Core-periphery structure; Higgs boson; Information diffusion model;" Scale-free networks"",""Bosons"; Diffusion; Community structures; Core peripheries; Epidemiological models; Higgs boson; Information diffusion; Information diffusion models; Real-world information; Standard information;" Complex networks"",""Gupta, Y."; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India;" email: yayati.gupta@iitrpr.ac.in"",,""Springer-Verlag Wien"",18695450,,,,""English"",""Soc.

Most of the existing literature assumes the knowledge of the underlying network and the knowledge of the diffusion model of propagation to solve the influence maximization problem. However, both the real-world information networks and their diffusion models are not easy to determine in practice. In this article, an influence maximization algorithm based on the observed cascades has been proposed. A novel idea that a good subset of nodes for influence maximization should be composed of nodes that are not only active and strong or influential by themselves but also independent of each other has been proposed. Based on this premise, the problem has been cast as a quadratic integer programming problem with constraints. Furthermore, this problem has been shown to be equivalent to a particular class of Max-GP problem, namely, max-not-cut with size k (MNC), for which the state-of-the-art semidefinite programming (SDP) solution techniques exist with guaranteed performance ratios, although the original problem is NP-hard. The new SDP-based method presented in this article is tested on a number of synthetic as well as real-world data sets and has been shown to perform better than the state-of-the-art influence maximization algorithms which work with the apriori knowledge of the network and assume a particular diffusion model. The results demonstrate its practical applicability in applications using Twitter, blogosphere, and other social networks which are being increasingly used to target influential customers for viral marketing. © 2014 IEEE."",""Complex networks"; influence maximization;" online social networks semidefinite programming (SDP)"",""Approximation algorithms"; Data structures; Diffusion; Equivalence classes; Inference engines; Information services; Integer programming; Knowledge engineering; Social networking (online); Computational model; Inference algorithm; Influence maximizations; Integrated circuit modeling; Semi-definite programming;" Complex networks"",""Kolli, N."; Indian Institute of ScienceIndia;" email: naimisha.k@gmail.com"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",2329924X,,,,""English"",""IEEE Trans.

Information diffusion is mainly important for two reasons, to study and forecast diffusion growth and to find the source of information and validate information clarity. Researchers study diffusion in social networks and observe different aspects of them which affect diffusion properties but, diffusion type of information diffusion is not studied before. Diffusion type is normal or anomalous which have different properties and should be modeled differently, for example, random walk in one-dimensional lattice is normal diffusion but what about random walk on networks? In this paper diffusion type of discrete time random walk (DTRW) and continuous time random walk (CTRW) over 1D lattice and simple graph are studied also, diffusion type of two social networks namely Twitter and Digg are studied. Anomalous diffusion is important since most of the systems in nature have normal diffusion and there are a few numbers of systems with anomalous diffusion. To the best of our knowledge this the first time where diffusion type of information diffusion in social networks is addressed. Our results show that information diffusion in both of the Digg and Twitter is anomalous and to be more specific it is subdiffusion but, by looking more deeply, diffusion type is superdiffusion in early hours after starting diffusion in some diffusions. Some strategies are introduced to make anomalous diffusions closer to normal diffusion, which is important for policy makers of health and marketing agencies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"",""Anomalous diffusion"; Diffusion type of social networks; Information diffusion in social networks; Information diffusion properties;" Mean squared displacement"",""Continuous time systems"; Diffusion; Random processes; Social networking (online); Anomalous diffusion; Anomalous information; Continuous-time random walk; Diffusion properties; Discrete-time random walk; Information diffusion; Mean squared displacement; One-dimensional lattice;" Economics"",""Ebrahimi, M."; Department of Network Science and Technology, North Kargar Street, Iran;" email: mo.ebrahimi@ut.ac.ir"",,""Elsevier Ltd"",09574174,,ESAPE,,""English"",""Expert Sys Appl"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066856513";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Users of social networks spread their opinions, get involved in discussions, and consequently, influence each other. However, the level of influence of different users is not the same. It varies not only among users, but also for one user across different topics. The structure of social networks and user-generated content can reveal immense information about users and their topic-based influence. Although many studies have considered measuring global user influence, measuring and estimating topic-based user influence has been under-explored. In this paper, we propose a collaborative topic-based social influence model that incorporates both network structure and user-generated content for topic-based influence measurement and prediction. We predict topic-based user influence on unobserved topics, based on observed topic-based user influence through their generated contents and activities in social networks.

Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) a widely used topic modeling technique is applied to capture the latent topics from the tweets’ documents. The major contribution of this work is twofold: constructing the dataset which serves as the ground-truth for analyzing the diffusion dynamics of spam/non-spam information and analyzing the effects of topics over the diffusibility. Exhaustive experiments clearly reveal the variation in topics shared by the spam and non-spam tweets.

Selection of seed nodes plays an important role in determining the levels and depth of the contagion in the network. This paper presents a comparative study when seed nodes for information propagation are selected through the properties of different centrality measures in the social network. This study captures the interaction measures of nodes in the social network, selects seed nodes based on five centrality measures, i.e. degree distribution, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, Eigenvector and PageRank, and compares the affected nodes and levels of propagation within the network. We demonstrate the performance of the different centrality measures by processing three datasets of social network: Twitter network, Bitcoin network and author collaborative network. For the propagation of the information, we use breadth-first search (BFS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) model and a detailed comparative study is also presented for each of the seed nodes selected using aforementioned network properties. Results show that the Eigenvector centrality and PageRank centrality measures outperform other centrality measures in all test cases in terms of propagation level and affected nodes during information propagation. Both Eigenvector and PageRank network data processing required a high computational overhead. For this reason we propose a hybrid model where using k-core the network is degenerated into a smaller network and centrality nodes are extracted from the smaller network. These centrality nodes, as compared to original centrality nodes, perform almost in the same manner in terms of influence maximization when k is chosen in a rational way. © 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences."",""centrality measures"; degenerative network; eigenvector; influence maximization; information propagation; Online social network; pageRank;" seed node"",""Data handling"; Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions; Information dissemination; Centrality measures; Influence maximizations; Information propagation; On-line social networks; PageRank;" Social networking (online)"",""Roy, S."; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India;" email: sarbani.roy@jadavpuruniversity.in"",,""Springer"",02562499,,SAPSE,,""English"",""Sadhana"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Bronze"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071934210";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The diverse patterns of increases in followers for the emerging influencers may be separated into several types. Among those types, Twitter users who posted objective disaster-related information in clear language and a consistent fashion tended to show an increase in followers and emerged as influential users. Additionally, professionals (from the media industry, public agencies and departments, and research organizations) made significant contributions to public information and warning during the hurricane.

By retweeting a tweet, users not only approve the information provided by the tweet but also share the similar emotions and sentiment expressed by the tweet. Analyzing tweets and retweets to discover user’s interest is a challenging and interesting task for researchers mainly in the field of information diffusion. In the past studies, it is usually assumed that a user retweets the tweets which match his topic of interest. However, not only the topic itself but also the emotion and sentiment related to the topic might have impact on user’s retweet decision.

The results suggest that Twitter is a highly valuable source of disaster-related information particularly during the power outage. With a substantial increase in the number of tweets and unique users during the Hurricane Sandy, a large number of posts contained firsthand information about the hurricane showing the intensity of the event in real-time. More specifically, a number of images of damage and flooding were shared on Twitter through which researchers and emergency managers can retrieve valuable information to help identify storm damages and plan relief efforts. The social media analysis revealed the most important information that can be derived from twitter during disasters so that authorities can successfully utilize such data. The findings provide insights into the choice of keywords and sentiments and identifying the influential actors at different stages of disasters. A number of key influencers and their followers from different domains including political, news, weather, and relief organizations participated in Twitter-based discussions related to Hurricane Sandy. The connectivity of the influencers and their followers on Twitter plays a vital role in information sharing and dissemination throughout the hurricane. These connections can provide an effective vehicle for emergency managers towards establishing better bi-directional communication during disasters. However, while government agencies were among the prominent Twitter users during the Hurricane Sandy, they primarily relied on one-way communication rather than engaging with their audiences, a challenge that need to be addressed in future research. © 2019"",""Disaster management"; Hurricane; Information diffusion; Social media; Social network analysis;" Twitter"",,""Mohanty, S."; Department of Computer Science University of North Carolina at Greensboro, PO Box 26170, United States;" email: mohanty_somya@uncg.edu"",,""Elsevier Ltd"",22124209,,,,""English"",""Int.

Existing methods have mainly relied on the network structure only for the detection of influential users. In this paper, we enrich this approach by proposing a fast, efficient, and unsupervised algorithm SmartInf to detect a set of influential users by identifying anchor nodes from a temporal sequence of retweets in Twitter cascades. Such anchor nodes provide important signatures of tweet diffusion across multiple diffusion localities and, hence, act as precursors for detection of influential nodes.1 The set of influential nodes identified by SmartInf has the capacity to expose the tweet to a large and diverse population, when targeted as seeds thereby maximizing the influence spread. Experimental evaluation on empirical datasets from Twitter shows the superiority of SmartInf over state-of-the-art baselines in terms of infecting larger population";" further, our evaluation shows that SmartInf is scalable to large-scale networks and is robust to missing data. Finally, we investigate the key factors behind the improved performance of SmartInf by testing our algorithm on a synthetic network using synthetic cascades simulated on this network. Our results reveal the effectiveness of SmartInf in identifying a diverse set of influential users that facilitate faster diffusion of tweets to a larger population.1We use the terms 'influential nodes' and 'influential users' interchangeably. © 2014 IEEE."",""Anchor nodes"; cascades; inter-retweet time intervals;" Smartinf"",""Cascades (fluid mechanics)"; Disease control; Large dataset; Population statistics; Anchor nodes; Diverse applications; Experimental evaluation; Information diffusion; On-line social networks; Smartinf; Time interval; Unsupervised algorithms;" Social networking (online)"",""Bhowmick, A.K."; Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India;" email: ayankb@iitkgp.ac.in"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",2329924X,,,,""English"",""IEEE Trans.

Given that users can easily post what they feel, Twitter is widely used as a platform to express emotions. These emotional expressions are considered to possibly influence user relationships on Twitter. In our previous study, we analyzed this influence using emotional word dictionaries. However, we could not measure the emotion scores for the words not included in the dictionaries. To solve this problem, in this study, we use the Naive Bayes and consider dependency parsing, i.e., the structure of tweets and the relationships of words. Furthermore, we introduce a set of new measures, namely total positive emotion score (TPES), total negative emotion score (TNES), and total neutral emotion score (TNtES). Based on these measures, we define a new composite index (CI) for emotion scores, which is a normalized value in the range of 0 to 1. We categorize users into positive and negative groups based on the composite index and test the difference of user relationships between these two groups with a statistical method. The result demonstrates that the relationships of positive users not only get better (i.e., the number increases) with time, but also tends to be mutual, which is consistent with the result of our previous study. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature."",""Brunner–Munzel test"; Dependency parsing; Emotional tweets; Influence analysis;" Naive Bayes"",""Social networking (online)"; Dependency parsing; Emotional expressions; Emotional tweets; Influence analysis; Naive bayes; Negative emotions; Normalized values; Social network service (SNS);" Classifiers"",""Jin, Q."; Faculty of Human Sciences, Japan;" email: jin@waseda.jp"",,""Springer New York LLC"",1386145X,,,,""English"",""World Wide Web"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047442784";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

They can be effective tools to understand what happens and when and where it happens, either retrospectively or in real time. Correspondingly, a variety of approaches have been proposed for detecting either targeted or general events. However, neither type of event detection technique has been developed to detect urban emergencies that happen in specific geographic locations and with unpredictable characteristics. Therefore, we propose a spatial and data-driven detecting urban emergencies technique (DUET) for natural hazards, manmade disasters, and other emergencies. The method addresses both geographic and semantic dimensions of events using a geotopic detection module and evaluates their crisis levels on the basis of the intensity of negative sentiment through a ranking module. DUET was designed specifically for georeferenced tweets from a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API). To validate the technique, we conducted multiple experiments with geotagged tweets in different urban environments over a period of four to six consecutive hours. DUET successfully identified emergencies of different types among all the candidate geotopics. Our future work focuses on enabling online-mode detection with high scalability with large volumes of streaming data and providing interactive visualization through a GIS system. DUET can identify emergencies of general types and provide timely emergency reports both to first responders and to the public. The technique contributes to building an efficient and open disaster information system through a crowdsourcing effort and adding agility to urban resilience regarding crisis detection, situation awareness, and information diffusion. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers."",""Disaster informatics"; Emergency detection; Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling; Natural language processing; Sentiment analysis;" Social media"",""Application programming interfaces (API)"; Data visualization; Disasters; Semantics; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Statistics; Visualization; Disaster information system; Emergency detection; Interactive visualizations; Latent Dirichlet allocation; NAtural language processing; Social media; Streaming applications; Topic Modeling;" Modeling languages"",""Taylor, J.E."; School of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Mason 4140c, United States;" email: jet@gatech.edu"",,""American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)"",08873801,,JCCEE,,""English"",""J.

Although aggregate metrics on the volume of information diffusion are available, we know little about how information spreads on online social networks. Health information could be transmitted from one to many (i.e. broadcasting) or from a chain of individual to individual (i.e. viral spreading). The aim of this study is to examine the spreading pattern of Ebola information on Twitter and identify influential users regarding Ebola messages. Methods: Our data was purchased from GNIP. We obtained all Ebola-related tweets posted globally from March 23, 2014 to May 31, 2015. We reconstructed Ebola-related retweeting paths based on Twitter content and the follower-followee relationships. Social network analysis was performed to investigate retweeting patterns. In addition to describing the diffusion structures, we classify users in the network into four categories (i.e., influential user, hidden influential user, disseminator, common user) based on following and retweeting patterns. Results: On average, 91% of the retweets were directly retweeted from the initial message. Moreover, 47.5% of the retweeting paths of the original tweets had a depth of 1 (i.e., from the seed user to its immediate followers). These observations suggested that the broadcasting was more pervasive than viral spreading. We found that influential users and hidden influential users triggered more retweets than disseminators and common users. Disseminators and common users relied more on the viral model for spreading information beyond their immediate followers via influential and hidden influential users. Conclusions: Broadcasting was the dominant mechanism of information diffusion of a major health event on Twitter. It suggests that public health communicators can work beneficially with influential and hidden influential users to get the message across, because influential and hidden influential users can reach more people that are not following the public health Twitter accounts. Although both influential users and hidden influential users can trigger many retweets, recognizing and using the hidden influential users as the source of information could potentially be a cost-effective communication strategy for public health promotion. However, challenges remain due to uncertain credibility of these hidden influential users. © 2019 The Author(s)."",""Broadcast model"; Ebola; Network analysis; Social media;" Viral diffusion model"",""article"; diffusion; human; human experiment; plant seed; public health; social media; social network; telecommunication; Ebola hemorrhagic fever; information dissemination; procedures; social media; statistics and numerical data; Hemorrhagic Fever, Ebola; Humans; Information Dissemination; Online Social Networking;" Social Media"",""Fu, K.-W."; Journalism and Media Studies Centre, Hong Kong;" email: kwfu@hku.hk"",,""BioMed Central Ltd."",14712458,,,""31023299"",""English"",""BMC Public Health"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065342416";

By organizing and categorizing the joint efforts of numerous studies on popularity prediction, this article presents a hierarchical taxonomy and helps to establish a systematic overview of popularity prediction methods for microblog. Specifically, we uncover three lines of thoughts: the feature-based approach, time-series modelling, and the collaborative filtering approach and analyse them, respectively. Furthermore, we also categorize prediction methods based on their underlying rationale: whether they attempt to model the motivation of users or monitor the early responses. Finally, we put these prediction methods to test by performing experiments on real-life data collected from popular social networks Twitter and Weibo. We compare the methods in terms of accuracy, efficiency, timeliness, robustness, and bias. As far as we are concerned, there is no precedented survey aimed at microblog popularity prediction at the time of submission. By establishing a taxonomy and evaluation for the first time, we hope to provide an in-depth review of state-of-the-art prediction methods and point out directions for further research. Our evaluations show that time-series modelling has the advantage of high accuracy and the ability to improve over time. The feature-based methods using only temporal features performs nearly as well as using all possible features, producing average results. This suggests that temporal features do have strong predictive power and that power is better exploited with time-series models.

One of the most intriguing aspects of social networks is to identify influencers who are experts on a specific topic. With the identification of these users within the network, many applications can be built for user recommendation, information diffusion modeling, viral marketing, user modeling and many more. In this paper, we aim to identify topic-based experts using a large dataset collected from Twitter. Our proposed approach has three phases: (1) identification of topics on social media posts (more specifically, tweets), (2) user modeling, based on a group of user specific features, and (3) Influence Factorization to identify topical influencers. The main advantage of the proposed method is to identify future influencers as well as current ones on Twitter. Moreover, it is an easy to implement algorithm using Spark MLlib, which can be easily extended to include other user specific features, and compare with other methodologies. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested on a large dataset that contains tweets of 180K user over 70 day period. The experimental results show that our proposed method identifies influencers successfully when used with a hybrid user specific feature that contains follower count and authenticity information, and is a highly scalable and extensible algorithm. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."",""Collaborative filtering"; Data mining; Influence analysis; Influence maximization; Influence prediction; Matrix Factorization;" Social media analysis"",""Collaborative filtering"; Data mining; Factorization; Social networking (online); Influence analysis; Influence maximizations; Influence predictions; Matrix factorizations; Social media analysis;" Behavioral research"",""Alp, Z.Z."; Institute of Science and Technology, Turkey;" email: zzalp@itu.edu.tr"",,""Elsevier B.V."",09507051,,KNSYE,,""English"",""Knowl Based Syst"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055732558";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The emergence of the Internet and especially social media platforms has reshaped this process and previous research has studied how online social networks contribute to the diffusion of information. Understanding such processes can help devise methods to maximize or control the reach of information or even identify upcoming events and social movements. Yet activities in cyberspace are still confined to physical locations and this geographic connection tends to be overlooked. In this research, we focus on geographic regions instead of individuals and study how the underlying hierarchical structure of regions relates to their response to the information. We examined the top 30 populated cities and metropolitan areas in the U.S. and retrieved Twitter data related to two selected topics from these regions, the 2015 Nepal Earthquake and the #JesuisCharlie hashtag in response to the Paris attacks on the Charlie Hebdo offices. We analyzed the similarity among regions of their response using multiple statistical methods and three urban classifications. Our results indicate that the diffusion of information is impacted by the hierarchy of urban regions and that the Twitter responses act more similar when the populated regions are positioned at the same level in the urban hierarchy. © 2019, © 2019 Wuhan University.

However, as a meme spreads, it evolves, and users adopt the meme in a variety of manners. While individual information cascades can model the propagation of a single piece of information among users, they are not useful in studying the propagation of the whole meme. Modelling the propagation of the whole meme has the ability to describe how users, who adopt the meme, are related to each other, identify who the seed author of the meme is, and recognize the main spreaders of this meme. In this work, we generalize the modelling of independent information cascades to model the diffusion of a meme. We argue that modelling information diffusion as a meme adoption graph (MAG), where each MAG comprises many contributing information cascades, offers a more comprehensive view of the larger scale meme adoption pattern. Hence presents a richer platform to study and monitor the information diffusion pattern of the generalized meme. To construct the MAG that represents the meme diffusion, we first identify messages related to a meme from the social network stream. We utilize a recent clustering algorithm to automatically extract and cluster tweets from the Twitter stream. Next, we evaluate and compare three epidemic models, typically used to construct individual information cascades. We then propose a set of structural characteristics derived from the MAG analysis that describe the underlying meme adoption pattern. Mainly, we focus on the influential spreaders, community formation, and virality measures of the generalized meme. An empirical study, using four real-world Twitter datasets, demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed MAG. For each dataset, the structural properties of the MAG are derived and compared to the characteristics derived from the independent cascades. © 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

It has many applications in advertising and marketing on social networks. In this article, we study a highly generic version of influence maximization, one of optimizing influence campaigns by sequentially selecting “spread seeds” from a set of influencers, a small subset of the node population, under the hypothesis that, in a given campaign, previously activated nodes remain persistently active. This problem is in particular relevant for an important form of online marketing, known as influencer marketing, in which the marketers target a sub-population of influential people, instead of the entire base of potential buyers. Importantly, we make no assumptions on the underlying diffusion model, and we work in a setting where neither a diffusion network nor historical activation data are available. We call this problem online influencer marketing with persistence (in short, OIMP). We first discuss motivating scenarios and present our general approach. We introduce an estimator on the influencers' remaining potential - the expected number of nodes that can still be reached from a given influencer - and justify its strength to rapidly estimate the desired value, relying on real data gathered from Twitter. We then describe a novel algorithm, GT-UCB, relying on probabilistic upper confidence bounds on the remaining potential. We show that our approach leads to high-quality spreads on both simulated and real datasets. Importantly, it is orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art influence maximization methods, making it possible to deal with large-scale online scenarios. © Copyright held by the owner/author(s)."",""Influence maximization"; Influencer marketing; Information diffusion; Multi-armed bandits; Online learning;" Online social networks"",""Marketing"; Influence maximizations; Information diffusion; Multi armed bandit; On-line social networks; Online learning;" Social networking (online)"",,,""Association for Computing Machinery"",15564681,,,,""English"",""ACM Trans.

Methods: In the current paper, we jointly model the hashtags present and the semantic concepts embedded in the content, which in turn helps us identify hashtag groups that define a “topic”—a concept space—that are used by a large number of tweets. Results: We observe that different hashtags belonging to a given cluster are more prominent compared to the others, at different times. We further observe that the participation and influence levels of the different users play important roles in determining which hashtag would be more prominent than the others at given times. We thus observe topics to often morph from one to the other (via morphing of dominant hashtags representing the same semantic concept space), rather than becoming extinct outright, which is a novel insight about topic lifecycles. We further present novel observations about the role of users in determining the lifecycle of discussion topics on Twitter. Conclusions: We infer that topic lifecycles are governed by user interests, and not by user influence, which is a key observation made by our work. © 2018, The Author(s)."",""Evolution of social topics"; Semantic clusters of hashtags as Twitter topics; Twitter topic lifecycle;" User influence in topic evolution"",,""Dey, K."; IBM Research, Vasant Kunj, India;" email: kuntadey@in.ibm.com"",,""SpringerOpen"",21974314,,,,""English"",""Comput.

To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first attempt to mine social media to extract quantitative and qualitative data for the art market. Although there are previous works on analyzing and predicting other markets, these methodologies cannot be applied directly to the art market. In our proposed methodology, artists will be treated as brands. That is, we will mine Twitter posts that mention specific artists’ names and attempt to rank artists in a similar manner as brand equity and awareness would be measured.

In this paper, we propose an integrated methodology for the data collection, the reconstruction, the analysis and the visualization of the development of a country’s political landscape from Twitter data. Method The proposed method relies solely on the interactions between Twitter accounts and is independent of the characteristics of the shared contents such as the language of the tweets. We validate our methodology on a case study on the 2017 French presidential election (60 million Twitter exchanges between more than 2.4 million users) via two independent methods: the comparison between our automated political categorization and a human categorization based on the evaluation of a sample of 5000 profiles descriptions"; the correspondence between the reconfigurations detected in the reconstructed political landscape and key political events reported in the media. This latter validation demonstrated the ability of our approach to accurately reflect the reconfigurations at play in the off-line political scene. Results We built on this reconstruction to give insights into the opinion dynamics and the reconfigurations of political communities at play during a presidential election. First, we propose a quantitative description and analysis of the political engagement of members of political communities. Second, we analyze the impact of political communities on information diffusion and in particular on their role in the fake news phenomena. We measure a differential echo chamber effect on the different types of political news (fake news, debunks, standard news) caused by the community structure and emphasize the importance of addressing the meso-structures of political networks in understanding the fake news phenomena. Conclusions Giving access to an intermediate level, between sociological surveys in the field and large statistical studies (such as those conducted by national or international organizations) we demonstrate that social networks data make it possible to qualify and quantify the activity of political communities in a multi-polar political environment;" as well as their temporal evolution and reconfiguration, their structure, their alliance strategies and their semantic particularities during a presidential campaign through the analysis of their digital traces. We conclude this paper with a comment on the political and ethical implications of the use of social networks data in politics. We stress the importance of developing social macroscopes that will enable citizens to better understand how they collectively make society and propose as example the “Politoscope”, a macroscope that delivers some of our results in an interactive way. © 2018 Gaumont et al.

Modeling information diffusion in such growing communication media is crucial in order both to understand information propagation and to better control it. Our research aims at predicting whether a post is going to be forwarded or not. Moreover, we aim at predicting how much it is going to be diffused. Our model is based on three types of features: user-based, time-based and content-based. Using three collections corresponding to a total of about 16 millions of tweets, we show that our model improves of about 5% F-measure compared to the state of the art, both when predicting if a tweet is going to be re-tweeted and when predicting how popular it will be. F-measure in our model is between 70% and 82%, depending on the collection. We also show that some features we introduced are very important to predict retweetability such as the numbers of followers and number of communities that a user belongs to. Our contribution in this paper is twofold: firstly we defined new features to represent tweets in order to predict their possible propagation";" secondly we evaluate the model we built on top of both features from the literature and features we defined on three collections and show the usefulness of our features in the prediction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."",""Information diffusion"; Microblogs; Predicting information propagation;" Tweet propagation"",""Information dissemination"; Social networking (online); Communication media; Information diffusion; Information propagation; Microblogs; Model informations; On-line social networks; State of the art; Twitter Analysis;" Forecasting"",""Mothe, J."; Université de Toulouse and IRIT, France;" email: josiane.mothe@irit.fr"",,""Elsevier B.V."",18777503,,,,""English"",""J.

The approach is demonstrated with two original models of information diffusion. These are a branching model of popularity and a epidemic model of popularity. The first is based on the principles of a branching process, while the second emulates an epidemic equation with a specific infection rate. This allows us to consider the replication phenomena on information diffusion. The approach is validated using a very large dataset collected online that involves keywords in blogs and hashtags on Twitter. Our main results point to an overall good fit of both models, both when the process of popularity grows and when it decays. This is due to endogenous information transfer, as in an epidemic process, but also when the process is initially triggered by an external event. Overall, on balance, our models confirm that popularity builds through message diffusion, which is of the multiplicative kind. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",""Branching models"; Epidemic models; Information diffusion; Online social media;" Popularity dynamics"",""Social networking (online)"; Branching process; Epidemic modeling; Epidemic models; Epidemic process; Information diffusion; Information transfers; Message propagation; Online social medias;" Epidemiology"",""Louçã, J."; ISTAR, cacifo 296, Av.

Studies have noted the distance decay effect in both cyberspace and real space, showing that interactions occur with an inverse relationship between the number of interactions and the distance between the locations of the interactors. However, these studies rarely provide strong evidence to show the influence of distance on interactions in cyberspace, nor do they quantify the differences in the amount of friction of distance between cyberspace and real space. To fill this gap, this study used massive amounts of social media data (Twitter) to compare the influence of distance decay on human interactions between cyberspace and real space in a quantitative manner. To estimate the distance decay effect in both cyberspace and real space, the distance decay function of interactions in each space was modeled. Estimating the distance decay in cyberspace in this study can help predict the degree of information flow across space through social media.

One of the challenges of crowd sourcing system is to recruit right users to be a part of successful campaigns. Fetching this right group of people, who influence a vast population to adopt information, is termed as influence maximization. Concerns of scalability and effectiveness need an effective and a viable solution. This paper proposes the solution in three stages. At the first stage, the large social network is pruned based on the nodal properties to make the solution scalable. At the second stage, Outdegree Rank (OR), is proposed and at the third stage, Influence Estimation (IE) approach estimates user influence. This work amalgamates aspects of structure, heuristic and user influence, to form STORIE. The proposed approach is compared to standard heuristics, on various experimental setups such as RNNDp, RNUDp and TVM. The spread of information is observed for HEP, PHY, Twitter, Infectious and YouTube data, under Independent Cascade model and STORIE gives optimal results, with an increase up to 50%.

This means that they are maturing networks";" and that they represent viable communities—not just a randomly connected graph. This is important for future studies in relation to information diffusion and opinion dynamics: how people share information and how does this help shape their views. On the semantic front, a lexicon was developed based on existing thesauri for customer satisfaction analysis. Keywords form each tweet were extracted and the topic(s) of each tweet was defined based on the lexicon. It was found that, based on the sample investigated, the behavior of 100-follower networks (networks with nodes having at least 100 followers) closely mimics the behavior of the overall network. Studying these networks (of influential users) can make analysis faster and may not impact accuracy. We also clustered each network into sub-networks: small, medium, and large. Topics discussed in medium-size networks tended to be unique. This seems to be the level where active discussions of specific topics take place. Focusing on detecting these and analyzing their contents can provide better chance for capturing the evolution of community opinions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"",""Customer satisfaction"; Energy saving; Ridership behavior; Semantic analysis; Social media;" Social network analysis"",""Customer satisfaction"; Data mining; Energy conservation; Sales; Semantics; Bi-directional communication; Communication policies; Customer satisfaction survey; Information diffusion; Online social medias; Ridership behavior; Semantic analysis; Social media;" Social networking (online)"",""El-Diraby, T."; Department of Civil Engineering, 35 St. George Street, Canada;" email: tamer@ecf.utoronto.ca"",,""Elsevier Ltd"",22106707,,,,""English"",""Sustainable Cities Soc."",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039694467";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The (retrospective) provenance of such data is equally important because it contributes to the understanding of the relevance and trustworthiness of the information. Furthermore, computing provenance in a timely way is crucial for particular use cases and practitioners, such as online journalists that promptly need to assess specific pieces of information. Social media currently provide insufficient mechanisms for provenance tracking, publication and generation, while state-of-the-art on social media research focuses mainly on explicit diffusion mechanisms (like retweets in Twitter or reshares in Facebook).The implicit diffusion mechanisms remain understudied due to the difficulties of being captured and properly understood. From a technical side, the state of the art for provenance reconstruction evaluates small datasets after the fact, sidestepping requirements for scale and speed of current social media data. In this paper, we investigate the mechanisms of implicit information diffusion by computing its fine-grained provenance. We prove that explicit mechanisms are insufficient to capture influence and our analysis unravels a significant part of implicit interactions and influence in social media. Our approach works incrementally and can be scaled up to cover a truly Web-scale scenario like major events. We can process datasets consisting of up to several millions of messages on a single machine at rates that cover bursty behaviour, without compromising result quality. By doing that, we provide to online journalists and social media users in general, fine grained provenance reconstruction which sheds lights on implicit interactions not captured by social media providers. These results are provided in an online fashion which also allows for fast relevance and trustworthiness assessment. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC."",""Incremental clustering"; Influence; Information diffusion; Provenance;" Social media"",""Economic and social effects"; Population statistics; Incremental clustering; Influence; Information diffusion; Provenance; Social media;" Social networking (online)"",""Taxidou, I."; University of Freiburg, Georges Köhler Allee 51, Germany;" email: taxidou@informatik.uni-freiburg.de"",,""Springer New York LLC"",09268782,,DAATE,,""English"",""Distrib Parallel Databases"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031937658";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

In this paper, a novel credit distribution (CD)-based model, termed as the multiaction CD (mCD) model, is introduced to quantify the influence ability of each user, which works with practical datasets where one type of action could be recorded for multiple times. Based on this model, influence maximization is formulated as a submodular maximization problem under a general knapsack constraint, which is NP hard. An efficient streaming algorithm with one-round scan over the user set is developed to find a suboptimal solution. Specifically, we first solve a special case of knapsack constraints, i.e., a cardinality constraint, and show that the developed streaming algorithm can achieve (1/2)-ϵ) approximation of the optimality. Furthermore, for the general knapsack case, we show that the modified streaming algorithm can achieve (1/3)-ϵ) approximation of the optimality. Finally, experiments are conducted over real Twitter dataset and demonstrate that the mCD model enjoys high accuracy compared to the conventional CD model in estimating the total number of people who get influenced in a social network. Moreover, through the comparison to the conventional CD, non-CD models, and the mCD model with the greedy algorithm on the performance of the influence maximization problem, we show the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed mCD model with the streaming algorithm. © 2018 IEEE."",""credit distribution"; influence maximization; Online social networks;" streaming algorithm"",""Approximation algorithms"; Budget control; Combinatorial optimization; Computers; Numerical models; Optimization; Social networking (online); Computational model; Credit distributions; Greedy algorithms; Influence maximizations; Integrated circuit modeling; On-line social networks; Streaming algorithm; Twitter;" Economic and social effects"",""Cui, S."; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, United States;" email: sgcui@ucdavis.edu"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",21693536,,,,""English"",""IEEE Access"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042705401";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore, our work tries to reveal the pattern by tracking retweeting behavior through user interest and categories of tweets. The key for modeling user interest is modeling topic distribution of tweets, which have non-Gaussian characteristics (e.g., power law distribution), thus we present the Latent Topics of user Interest(LTI) model which make full use of the non-Gaussian distribution of topics among tweets to uncover user interest and then predict users’ possible actions. After dividing users into conceit users and altruism users by whether they have definite selection when retweeting, and categorizing tweets into repeated hot tweets and novel hot tweets by whether its topics always occur in the training set, we demonstrates a pattern – the conceit users promotes the diffusion of repeated hot tweets, whereas the altruism users expands the diffusion of novel hot tweets, and the pattern is evaluated by the correlation coefficient between types of users and tweets, which is greater than.61 for 10 and 100 million tweets of Weibo2 and Twitter with respect to 70 and 58 thousand users over a period of one month. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."",""Altruism"; Conceit; Information diffusion; Non-Gaussian topic distribution;" User interest"",""Gaussian distribution"; Gaussian noise (electronic); Social networking (online); Altruism; Conceit; Information diffusion; Topic distributions; User interests; Behavioral research; Article; behavior; classification algorithm; human; non Gaussian distribution; prediction; priority journal; retweeting behavior; social network; statistical distribution;" statistical model"",""Li, J."; School of Computer Science & Engineering, China;" email: lijx@act.buaa.edu.cn"",,""Elsevier B.V."",09252312,,NRCGE,,""English"",""Neurocomputing"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029164434";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Key issues in understanding social media and such services include how to generate more information traffic and how to increase information exposure. Unlike previous studies in the research stream studying patterns of information diffusion, we investigate the role of influential Twitter users, focusing on their positions in social networks, in redistributing contents generated by other users. To do this, we employ sociological theories in determining which characteristics of connecting users provide more influence. Specifically, a connecting user's position in networks observable to audience affects the user's influence in a way that connecting users with relatively high status and those embedded in a closely connected community exert the greatest impact on the network. Moreover, the value of a connecting user's network position can be contingent on the source user's status and network position: a high-status connecting user contributes more to information diffusion when tweets are generated by a low-status source user, and a connecting user who is embedded in a well-connected network contributes more to information diffusion when tweets are generated by a source user in a brokerage position. After exploring data on tweets about Apple products and services, we find evidence that support this set of theoretical claims. Such findings would also provide a useful guidance for practitioners to enhance information diffusion by effectively designing the sequence of content recipients based on their network positions."",""Brokerage"; Connecting User; Information Diffusion; Information Flow Network; Social Network Analysis (SNA) Social Network Services (SNS);" Status"",""Hardware"; Information systems; Brokerage; Connecting User; Information diffusion; Information flow networks; Social network service (SNS); Status;" Social networking (online)"",,,""Association for Computing Machinery"",00950033,,,,""English"",""Data Base Adv.

Users can even share live streams whenever they want to reach out to many other. This prevalent usage of social media attracted companies, data scientists, and researchers who are trying to infer meaningful information from this vast amount of data. Information diffusion and maximizing the spread of words is one of the most important focus for researchers working on social media. This information can serve many purposes such as";" user or content recommendation, viral marketing, and user modeling. In this research, finding topical influential/authority users on Twitter is addressed. Since Twitter is a good platform to spread knowledge as a word of mouth approach and it has many more public profiles than protected ones, it is a target media for marketers. In this paper, we introduce a novel methodology, called Personalized PageRank, that integrates both the information obtained from network topology and the information obtained from user actions and activities in Twitter. The proposed approach aims to determine the topical influencers who are experts on a specific topic. Experimental results on a large dataset consisting of Turkish tweets show that using user specific features like topical focus rate, activeness, authenticity and speed of getting reaction on specific topics positively affects identifying influencers and lead to higher information diffusion.

Real applications such as viral marketing and trending topic detection rely on information diffusion. Given past items with diffusion records on a social network, this paper aims at forecasting who will participate in the diffusion of a new item c (we use hashtags in the paper) with its k earliest adopters, without using content and profile information, i.e., finding which users will adopt c in the future. We define the Diffusion Participation Forecasting (DPF) problem, which is challenging since all users except for early adopters can be the candidates, comparing to existing studies that predict which one-layer followers will adopt a new hashtag given past diffusion observations with content and profile info. To solve the DFP problem, we propose an Adoption-based Participation Ranking (APR) model, which aims to rank the actual participants in reality at higher positions. The first is to estimate the adoption probability of a new hashtag for each user while the second is a random walk-based model that incorporates nodes with higher adoption probability values and early adopters to generate the forecasted participants. Experiments conducted on Twitter exhibit that our model can significantly outperform several competing methods in terms of Precision and Recall. Moreover, we demonstrate that an accurate DPF can be applied for effective targeted marketing using influence maximization and boosting the accuracy of popularity prediction in social media. © 2017 Elsevier Inc."",""Diffusion forecasting"; Diffusion participation; Information diffusion; Popularity prediction; Social influence;" Social network"",""Commerce"; Marketing; Social networking (online); Influence maximizations; Information diffusion; Popularity predictions; Precision and recall; Real applications; Social influence; Social networking services; Targeted marketing;" Forecasting"",""Yeh, M.-Y."; Department of Statistics, Taiwan;" email: miyen@iis.sinica.edu.tw"",,""Elsevier Inc."",00200255,,ISIJB,,""English"",""Inf Sci"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029406724";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We analyze 4.1 million messages (tweets) obtained from Twitter. Although factors affecting message diffusion on social media have been studied previously, we focus on message sentiment and reveal how the polarity of message sentiment affects its virality. The virality of a message is characterized by the number of message repostings (retweets) and the time elapsed from the original posting of a message to its Nth reposting (N-retweet time). Through extensive analysis using the 4.1 million tweets and their retweets in 1 week, we discover that negative messages are likely to be reposted more rapidly and frequently than positive and neutral messages. Specifically, the reposting volume of negative messages is 20–60% higher than that of positive and neutral messages, and negative messages spread 25% faster than positive and neutral messages when the diffusion volume is quite high. We also perform longitudinal analysis of message diffusion observed over 1 year and find that recurrent diffusion of negative messages is less frequent than that of positive and neutral messages. Moreover, we present a simple message diffusion model that can reproduce the characteristics of message diffusion observed in this paper. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien."",""Information diffusion"; Retweet; Sentiment; Social media;" Twitter"",""Information diffusion"; Retweet; Sentiment; Social media; Twitter;" Social networking (online)"",""Tsugawa, S."; Faculty of Engineering, 1-1-1 Tennodai, Japan;" email: s-tugawa@cs.tsukuba.ac.jp"",,""Springer-Verlag Wien"",18695450,,,,""English"",""Soc.

We address two questions: what is the relation between the Twitter mood and the referendum outcome, and who were the most influential Twitter users in the pro- and contra-Brexit camps? First, we construct a stance classification model by machine learning methods, and are then able to predict the stance of about one million UK-based Twitter users. The demography of Twitter users is, however, very different from the demography of the voters. By applying a simple age-adjusted mapping to the overall Twitter stance, the results show the prevalence of the pro-Brexit voters, something unexpected by most of the opinion polls. Second, we apply the Hirsch index to estimate the influence, and rank the Twitter users from both camps. We find that the most productive Twitter users are not the most influential, that the pro-Brexit camp was four times more influential, and had considerably larger impact on the campaign than the opponents. Third, we find that the top pro-Brexit communities are considerably more polarized than the contra-Brexit camp.

The research problem is formulated as a classification task, and machine-learning models are developed. In addition to features used to represent users’ static information, features that can be used to measure users’ social influence are also introduced. These features are constructed from information obtained from the Klout. The experimental data were sourced from Twitter. After data pretreatment, a 10-fold cross validation experiment is adopted. In case of overfitting, a sensitivity test was also conducted under data imbalance situation. The experimental results show that the model with social influence features outperforms the model without such features, which demonstrate the effectiveness and necessity of taking users’ social influence into consideration.

Given the large number of users in social networks and also the various relations that exist among them, providing an effective method to identify influential users has been gradually considered as an essential factor. In most of the already-provided methods, those users who are located in an appropriate structural position of the network are regarded as influential users. These methods do not usually pay attention to the interactions among users, and also consider those relations as being binary in nature. This paper, therefore, proposes a new method to identify influential users in a social network by considering those interactions that exist among the users. Since users tend to act within the frame of communities, the network is initially divided into different communities. Then the amount of interaction among users is used as a parameter to set the weight of relations existing within the network. Afterward, by determining the neighbors’ role for each user, a two-level method is proposed for both detecting users’ influence and also ranking them. Simulation and experimental results on twitter data shows that those users who are selected by the proposed method, comparing to other existing ones, are distributed in a more appropriate distance. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the other ones in terms of both the influential speed and capacity of the users it selects. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."",""Influential users"; SIR diffusion model; Social networks; Spreading process;" Users’ interaction"",""Physics"; Amount of interaction; Appropriate distances; Diffusion model; Influential users; On-line social networks; Two level methods;" Social networking (online)"",""Sheikhahmadi, A."; Department of Computer Engineering, Iran;" email: sheikhahmadi@eng.ui.ac.ir"",,""Elsevier B.V."",03784371,,PHYAD,,""English"",""Phys A Stat Mech Appl"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020914568";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Major portion of the studies done in the field of information diffusion through social networks has focused on the problem of influence maximization. These methods demand the diffusion probabilities associated with the links in the social networks to be provided as inputs. However, the problem of computing these diffusion probabilities has not been as widely explored as the problem of influence maximization. In this paper, we tackle the problem of predicting the probabilities of diffusion of a message through the links of a social network.

One question that systematically recurs is whether information spreads according to simple or complex dynamics: does each exposure to a piece of information have an independent probability of a user adopting it (simple contagion), or does this probability depend instead on the number of sources of exposure, increasing above some threshold (complex contagion)? Most studies to date are observational and, therefore, unable to disentangle the effects of confounding factors such as social reinforcement, homophily, limited attention, or network community structure. Here we describe a novel controlled experiment that we performed on Twitter using ‘social bots’ deployed to carry out coordinated attempts at spreading information. We propose two Bayesian statistical models describing simple and complex contagion dynamics, and test the competing hypotheses. We provide experimental evidence that the complex contagion model describes the observed information diffusion behavior more accurately than simple contagion. Future applications of our results include more effective defenses against malicious propaganda campaigns on social media, improved marketing and advertisement strategies, and design of effective network intervention techniques. © 2017 Mønsted et al.

The goals of this study were twofold: (a) to identify the major themes contained in tweets about the campaign under investigation and (b) to understand the roles of retweeting in a health campaign as well as factors that contribute to the wide dissemination of campaign messages on Twitter. Tweets that included the campaign hashtag of Breast Cancer Awareness Month, #bcam, were collected using the firehose method (N = 1018). Findings revealed that many more tweets were posted about the promotional goals of fundraising or sales events than about the educational goals of teaching and raising awareness about breast cancer. Findings also showed that tweets with photos or images exhibited greater retweetability compared to those without them, whereas the inclusion of hyperlinks or videos did not affect retweetability. The results of the current study shed light on our understanding of the ways Twitter is used in health promotion and offer practical implications regarding strategic use of Twitter for health campaigns. © 2017"",""Health campaign"; Information diffusion;" Social media"",""Diseases"; Hypertext systems; Social networking (online); Breast Cancer; Educational goals; Fire-hose; Health promotion; Hyperlinks; Information diffusion; Social media;" Health"",,,""Elsevier Ltd"",07475632,,CHBEE,,""English"",""Comput.

In particular, most of businesses are trying to exploit such social networking services for more profit, since it has dramatically become an information carrier for customers who are disseminating latest information about products and services. Thus, this study examines how information shared by companies is distributed and what the important factors in understanding information dissemination are. More importantly, this study classifies the types of tweets posted by a company and then to investigate the effect of these types of tweets on diffusion. By using content analysis, this study defined three types, which are i) information provision (IF), ii) advertisement (AD), and iii) both (IFAD), with 8 specific concepts. These results indicate that the differences are significant for all three types of information content. It shows that companies can spread information more quickly by providing the IFAD type rather than the AD type. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",""Business intelligence"; Content-based Analytics; Information diffusion; Social big data;" Social media"",""Competitive intelligence"; Information dissemination; Sales; Social networking (online); Content-based; Information carriers; Information contents; Information diffusion; Information provision; Products and services; Social media; Social networking services;" Big data"",""Jung, J.E."; Computer Science Department, South Korea;" email: j3ung@cau.ac.kr"",,""Springer New York LLC"",1383469X,,,,""English"",""Mobile Networks Appl"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007500890";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Through the 'world-of-mouth' exchanges, so-called viral marketing, the influence and product adoption can spread from few key influencers to billions of users in the network. To identify those key influencers, a great amount of work has been devoted for the influence maximization (IM) problem that seeks a set of k seed users that maximize the expected influence. Unfortunately, IM encloses two impractical assumptions: 1) any seed user can be acquired with the same cost and 2) all users are equally interested in the advertisement. In this paper, we propose a new problem, called cost-aware targeted viral marketing ( CTVM), to find the most cost-effective seed users, who can influence the most relevant users to the advertisement. Since CTVM is NP-hard, we design an efficient (1- 1 e-) -approximation algorithm, named Billion-scale Cost-award Targeted algorithm (BCT), to solve the problem in billion-scale networks. Comparing with IM algorithms, we show that BCT is both theoretically and experimentally faster than the state-of-the-arts while providing better solution quality. Moreover, we prove that under the linear threshold model, BCT is the first sub-linear time algorithm for CTVM (and IM) in dense networks. We carry a comprehensive set of experiments on various real-networks with sizes up to several billion edges in diverse disciplines to show the absolute superiority of BCT on both CTVM and IM domains. Experiments on Twitter data set, containing 1.46 billions of social relations and 106 millions tweets, show that BCT can identify key influencers in trending topics in only few minutes. © 1993-2012 IEEE."",""Influence maximization"; sampling Alg;" Viral marketing"",""Clustering algorithms"; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Marketing; Problem solving; Social networking (online); Influence maximizations; Linear threshold models; Linear-time algorithms; On-line social networks; Product adoption; Social relations; Solution quality; State of the art;" Approximation algorithms"",""Dinh, T.N."; Department of Computer Science, United States;" email: tndinh@vcu.edu"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",10636692,,IEANE,,""English"",""IEEE ACM Trans Networking"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Bronze"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018632800";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Billions of people tweet, sharing, post, and discuss everyday. Due to this increased activity, social media platforms provide new opportunities for research about human behavior, information diffusion, and influence propagation at a scale that is otherwise impossible. Social media data is a new treasure trove for data mining and predictive analytics. Since social media data differs from conventional data, it is imperative to study its unique characteristics. This work investigates data collection bias associated with social media. In particular, we propose computational methods to assess if there is bias due to the way a social media site makes its data available, to detect bias from data samples without access to the full data, and to mitigate bias by designing data collection strategies that maximize coverage to minimize bias. We also present a new kind of data bias stemming from API attacks with both algorithms, data, and validation results. This work demonstrates how some characteristics of social media data can be extensively studied and verified and how corresponding intervention mechanisms can be designed to overcome negative effects.

Infection (or Information) diffusion is modeled using the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model. Mean field approximation is employed to approximate the discrete valued infection dynamics by a deterministic difference equation, thereby yielding a generative model for the infection diffusion. The infection is shown to follow polynomial dynamics and is estimated using an exact nonlinear Bayesian filter. We compute posterior Cramér-Rao bounds to obtain the fundamental limits of the filter that depend on the structure of the network. The SIS model is extended to include homophily, and filtering on these networks is illustrated. Considering the randomly evolving nature of real world networks, a filtering algorithm for estimating the underlying degree distribution is also investigated using generative models for the time evolution of the network. We validate the efficacy of the proposed models and algorithms with synthetic data and Twitter datasets. We find that the SIS model is a satisfactory fit for the information diffusion, and the nonlinear filter effectively tracks the information diffusion. © 2015 IEEE."",""Cramér-Rao bounds"; diffusion threshold; homophily; mean-field dynamics; non-linear Bayesian filter; social Networks; stochastic dominance;" twitter dataset"",""Difference equations"; Dynamics; Signal filtering and prediction; Social networking (online); Stochastic systems; Bayesian filters; Homophily; Mean field dynamics; Stochastic Dominance; twitter dataset;" Bayesian networks"",""Krishnamurthy, V."; School of Electrical and Computer Engineering and Cornell Tech, United States;" email: vikramk@cornell.edu"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",2373776X,,,,""English"",""IEEE Trans.

With an increase in Twitter usage, we need a more effective method to analyze Twitter content. In this paper, we propose a method for content analysis based on the influence of Twitter content. For measuring Twitter influence, we use the number of followers of the content author, retweet count, and currency of time. We perform experiments to compare the proposed method, frequency, numerical statistics, user influence, and sentiment score.

Online users are constantly creating new links when exposed to new information sources, and in turn these links are alternating the way information spreads. However, these two highly intertwined stochastic processes, information diffusion and network evolution, have been predominantly studied separately, ignoring their co-evolutionary dynamics. We propose a temporal point process model, Coevolve, for such joint dynamics, allowing the intensity of one process to be modulated by that of the other. This model allows us to efficiently simulate interleaved diffusion and network events, and generate traces obeying common diffusion and network patterns observed in real-world networks such as Twitter. Furthermore, we also develop a convex optimization framework to learn the parameters of the model from historical diffusion and network evolution traces.

Timely knowledge about what kinds of information are diffusing in social media is quite important. For example, in emergency situations such as earthquakes, users provide instant information on their situation through social media. The collective intelligence of social media is useful as a means of information detection complementary to conventional observation. We have developed a system for monitoring and analyzing information diffusion data in realtime by tracking retweeted tweets. A tweet retweeted by many users indicates that they find the content interesting and impactful. Analysts who use this system can find tweets retweeted by many users and identify the key people who are retweeted frequently by many users or who have retweeted tweets about particular topics. However, bursting situations occur when thousands of social media messages are suddenly posted simultaneously, and the lack of machine resources to handle such situations lowers the system's query performance. Since our system is designed to be used interactively in real-Time by many analysts, waiting more than one second for a query results is simply not acceptable. To maintain an acceptable query performance, we propose a capacity control method for filtering incoming tweets using extra attribute information from tweets themselves.

How quickly does a piece of news spread over these media? How does its popularity diminish over time? Does the rising and falling pattern follow a simple universal law? In this article, we propose SPIKEM, a concise yet flexible analytical model of the rise and fall patterns of information diffusion. Our model has the following advantages. First, unification power: it explains earlier empirical observations and generalizes theoretical models including the SI and SIR models. We provide the threshold of the take-off versus die-out conditions for SPIKEMand discuss the generality of our model by applying it to an arbitrary graph topology. Second, practicality: it matches the observed behavior of diverse sets of real data. Third, parsimony: it requires only a handful of parameters. Fourth, usefulness: it makes it possible to perform analytic tasks such as forecasting, spotting anomalies, and interpretation by reverse engineering the system parameters of interest (quality of news, number of interested bloggers, etc.). We also introduce an efficient and effective algorithm for the real-Time monitoring of information diffusion, namely SPIKESTREAM, which identifies multiple diffusion patterns in a large collection of online event streams. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that SPIKEM accurately and succinctly describes all patterns of the rise and fall spikes in social networks. © 2017 ACM."",""Information diffusion"; Nonlinear modeling;" Social networks"",""Reverse engineering"; Search engines; Social networking (online); Arbitrary graphs; Diffusion patterns; Effective algorithms; Event streams; Information diffusion; Non-linear model; Real data sets; Real time monitoring;" Topology"",,,""Association for Computing Machinery"",15591131,,,,""English"",""ACM Trans.

OSNs provide researchers and scientists with unique prospects to comprehend individuals on a scale and to analyze human behavioral patterns. Influential spreaders identification is an important subject in understanding the dynamics of information diffusion in OSNs. Targeting these influential spreaders is significant in planning the techniques for accelerating the propagation of information that is useful for various applications, such as viral marketing applications or blocking the diffusion of annoying information (spreading of viruses, rumors, online negative behaviors, and cyberbullying). Existing K-core decomposition methods consider links equally when calculating the influential spreaders for unweighted networks. Alternatively, the proposed link weights are based only on the degree of nodes. Thus, if a node is linked to high-degree nodes, then this node will receive high weight and is treated as an important node. Conversely, the degree of nodes in OSN context does not always provide accurate influence of users. In the present study, we improve the K-core method for OSNs by proposing a novel link-weighting method based on the interaction among users. The proposed method is based on the observation that the interaction of users is a significant factor in quantifying the spreading capability of user in OSNs. The tracking of diffusion links in the real spreading dynamics of information verifies the effectiveness of our proposed method for identifying influential spreaders in OSNs as compared with degree centrality, PageRank, and original K-core. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."",""Complex networks"; Influential spreaders; K-shell decomposition; Online social networks; Social media;" Twitter"",""Behavioral research"; Complex networks; Spreaders; Viruses; Behavioral patterns; Decomposition methods; Information diffusion; K-shells; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Social media; Twitter;" Social networking (online)"",""Al-garadi, M.A."; Department of Information Systems, Malaysia;" email: mohammedali@siswa.um.edu.my"",,""Elsevier B.V."",03784371,,PHYAD,,""English"",""Phys A Stat Mech Appl"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-85003986559";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

A longitudinal test over 15 months of data demonstrates that not only that the proposed model accurately predicts food prices, but it is also resilient to data scarcity. The high accuracy of the nowcast model is attributed to the observed trend that the volume of tweets mentioning food prices tends to increase on days when food prices change sharply.

We have built two datasets with respectively 489,000 and 280,000 financial tweets. While getting additional followers may provide insight of an increasing popularity, it does not necessarily translate into a more influential position. Our results suggest that the number of followers is only one element of what is considered to be influential. Indeed, the number of messages can be biased by what can be described as 'noisy' users. The number of retweets is a more refined proxy about influence. Finally, the betweenness centrality in the retweet network provides some privileged information to anyone following these users. We compare the performance of stocks mentioned by each type of users. From these results, such methods of assessing influence on Twitter leverage the acquisition of preferential signals in a financial context.

We stress our attention on the susceptible-infected model, a type of epidemic models, to describe the process of information diffusion. In general, OSNs can be classified into two categories, Facebook-like OSNs and Twitter-like OSNs. The former ones require bidirectional connections, while the latter do not, so we use the undirected unweighted graph and directed unweighted graph to describe them, respectively. We also pay additional attention to the nonidentity of the link probability on information transmission and build the weight graph, which can also cover both the two types of OSNs. In order to determine values of weight graph's weights, we introduce a learning method to obtain useful factors from raw data for assessing the true link probability on information transmission. Based on spectral analysis within the three graphs, our investigations on the information diffusion show that the spectral radius of the graph adjacency matrix can reflect the capability of information propagation, according to which we could determine effective initiators. We conduct our simulations on real OSNs. Experimental results show that our approach could effectively discover the initiators that spread information widely. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Results: We have used this concept and measure of influence to determine optimal seeds in a simulation of influence maximization using two empirically collected social networks for the underlying graphs. Conclusions: Our empirical results on the datasets demonstrate that our measure stands out as a useful measure to define the attractors comparing to the other influence measures. © 2016, The Author(s)."",""Asterisk"; Detection of attractors; Independent cascade model; Information diffusion; Social media networks;" Twitter"",,""Qasem, Z."; Computer Science Institute, Lützowstraße 5, Germany;" email: ziyaad.qasem@hs-ruhrwest.de"",,""SpringerOpen"",21974314,,,,""English"",""Comput.

To assess this cultural pulse, it is critical to have an accurate assessment of who is saying what. Unfortunately, social media is also the home of users who engage in disruptive, disingenuous, and potentially illegal activity. A range of users, both human and non-human, carry out such social cyber-attacks. We ask, to what extent does the presence or absence of such users influence our ability to assess the cultural pulse of a region? Our prior research on this topic showed that Twitter-based network structures and content are unstable and can be highly impacted by the removal of suspended users. Because of this, statistical techniques can be established to differentiate potential types of suspended and non-suspended users. In this extended paper, we develop additional experiments to explore the spatial patterns of suspended users, and we further consider how these users affect structural and content concentrations via the development of new metrics and new analyses. We find significant evidence that suspended users exist on the periphery of social networks on Twitter and consequently that removing them has little impact on network structure. We also improve prior attempts to distinguish among different types of suspended users by using a much larger dataset. Finally, we conduct a temporal sentiment analysis to illustrate differences between suspended users and non-suspended users on this dimension. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien."",,""Crime"; Network security; Additional experiments; Cyber-attacks; Illegal activities; Network stability; Network structures; Sentiment analysis; Spatial patterns; Statistical techniques;" Social networking (online)"",""Wei, W."; School of Computer Science, United States;" email: weiwei@cs.cmu.edu"",,""Springer-Verlag Wien"",18695450,,,,""English"",""Soc.

There are two different ways of information diffusion in social media platforms such as Twitter and Weibo. Users can either re-share messages posted by their friends or re-create messages based on the information acquired from other non-local information sources such as the mass media. By analyzing around 60 million messages from a large micro-blog site, we find that about 69 % of the diffusion volume can be attributed to users’ re-sharing behaviors, and the remaining 31 % are caused by user re-creating behaviors. The information diffusions caused by the two kinds of behaviors have different characteristics and variation trends, but most existing models of information diffusion do not distinguish them. The recent availability of massive online social streams allows us to study the process of information diffusion in much finer detail. In this paper, we introduce a novel model to capture and simulate the process of information diffusion in the micro-blog platforms, which distinguishes users’ re-sharing behaviors from re-creating behaviors by introducing two different components. Thus, our model not only considers the effect of the underlying network structure, but also the influence of other non-local information sources. The empirical results show the superiority of our proposed model in the fitting and prediction tasks of information diffusion. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",""Information diffusion"; Re-creation;" Re-share"",""Internet"; Social networking (online); Information diffusion; Mass media; Micro-blog; Prediction tasks; Social media; Social media platforms; Social streams; Underlying networks;" Behavioral research"",""Cui, B."; Key Lab of High Confidence Software Technologies (MOE), China;" email: bin.cui@pku.edu.cn"",,""Springer New York LLC"",1386145X,,,,""English"",""World Wide Web"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-84949813608";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Despite that CI applies to the influence maximization problem in percolation model, it is still important to examine its efficacy in realistic information spreading. Here, we examine real-world information flow in various social and scientific platforms including American Physical Society, Facebook, Twitter and LiveJournal. Since empirical data cannot be directly mapped to ideal multi-source spreading, we leverage the behavioral patterns of users extracted from data to construct """"virtual"""" information spreading processes.

Moreover, local measures as the number of connections or citations are not necessarily the deterministic factors of nodes' importance in realistic information spreading.

How to measure the influence of Twitter users has attracted significant academic and industrial attention. Existing influence measurement techniques are vulnerable to sybil users that are thriving on Twitter. Although sybil defenses for online social networks have been extensively investigated, they commonly assume unique mappings from human-established trust relationships to online social associations and thus do not apply to Twitter where users can freely follow each other. This paper presents TrueTop, the first sybil-resilient system to measure the influence of Twitter users. TrueTop is rooted in two observations from real Twitter datasets. First, although non-sybil users may incautiously follow strangers, they tend to be more careful and selective in retweeting, replying to, and mentioning other users. Second, influential users usually get much more retweets, replies, and mentions than non-influential users. Detailed theoretical studies and synthetic simulations show that TrueTop can generate very accurate influence measurement results with strong resilience to sybil attacks. © 1993-2012 IEEE."",""Influence measurement"; social networks; sybil resilience;" Twitter"",""Information dissemination"; Influential users; Measurement techniques; On-line social networks; sybil resilience; Synthetic simulation; Theoretical study; Trust relationship; Twitter;" Social networking (online)"",,,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",10636692,,IEANE,,""English"",""IEEE ACM Trans Networking"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027068000";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Some individuals engage through online social networks (e.g., Facebook, Twitter), while some communicate only through conventional ways (e.g., face-to-face). Therefore, understanding the dynamics of information propagation among humans calls for a multi-layer network model where an online social network is conjoined with a physical network. In this work, we initiate a study of information diffusion in a clustered multi-layer network model, where all constituent layers are random networks with high clustering. We assume that information propagates according to the SIR model and with different information transmissibility across the networks. We give results for the conditions, probability, and size of information epidemics, i.e., cases where information starts from a single individual and reaches a positive fraction of the population. We show that increasing the level of clustering in either one of the layers increases the epidemic threshold and decreases the final epidemic size in the whole system. An interesting finding is that information with low transmissibility spreads more effectively with a small but densely connected social network, whereas highly transmissible information spreads better with the help of a large but loosely connected social network. © 2013 IEEE."",""clustered multilayer networks"; Information propagation; percolation theory;" random graphs"",""Epidemiology"; Graph theory; Information dissemination; Multilayers; Online systems; Social networking (online); Solvents; Epidemic threshold; Information diffusion; Information propagation; Multi-layer network; On-line social networks; Percolation theory; Physical network; Random graphs;" Network layers"",,,""IEEE Computer Society"",23274697,,,,""English"",""IEEE Trans.

As a means of gathering and sharing information, humanitarian organizations are becoming increasingly reliant on social media platforms based on the Internet. In this paper, we present a field study that examines how effectively information diffuses through social media networks embedded in these platforms. Using a large dataset from Twitter during Hurricane Sandy, we first applied Information Diffusion Theory to characterize diffusion rates. Then, we empirically examined the impact of key elements on information propagation rates on social media. Our results revealed that internal diffusion through social media networks advances at a significantly higher speed than information in these networks coming from external sources. This finding is important because it suggests that social media networks are effective at passing information along during humanitarian crises that require urgent information diffusion. Our results also indicate that dissemination rates depend on the influence of those who originate the information. Moreover, they suggest that information posted earlier during a disaster exhibits a significantly higher speed of diffusion than information that is introduced later during more eventful stages in the disaster. This is because, over time, participation in the diffusion of information declines as more and more communications compete for attention among users. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."",""Humanitarian operations"; Information diffusion theory;" Social media"",""Complex networks"; Disaster prevention; Disasters; Hurricanes; Information dissemination; Disaster relief operations; Humanitarian operations; Information diffusion; Information propagation; Social media; Social media networks; Social media platforms; Uncertainty and complexity;" Social networking (online)"",""Rabinovich, E."; Department of Supply Chain Management, P.O.

However, the massive amount of information available causes information overload, which prevents users from quickly accessing popular and important digital content. This paper studies the problem of predicting the popularity of social multimedia content embedded in short microblog messages. A property of social multimedia is that it can be continuously re-shared, thus its popularity may revive or evolve over time. We exploit the idea of concept drift to capture this property. We formulate the problem using a classification-based approach and propose to tackle two tasks, re-share classification and popularity score classification. Two categories of features are devised and extracted, including information diffusion and explicit multimedia meta information. We develop a concept drift-based popularity predictor by ensembling multiple trained classifiers from social multimedia instances in different time intervals. The key idea lies in dynamically determining the ensemble weights of classifiers.

Through the analysis of OSNs, many social phenomena have been studied, such as the viral diffusion of information amongst people. What is still unclear is the relation between micro-level structural properties of OSNs (i.e. the properties of the personal networks of the users, also known as ego networks) and the emergence of such phenomena. A better knowledge of this relation could be essential for the creation of services for the Future Internet, such as highly personalised advertisements fitted on users' needs and characteristics. In this paper, we contribute to bridge this gap by analysing the ego networks of a large sample of Facebook and Twitter users. We show that micro-level structural properties of OSNs are interestingly similar to those found in social networks formed offline. In particular, online ego networks show the same structure found offline, with social contacts arranged in layers with compatible size and composition. From the analysis of Twitter ego networks, we have been able to find a direct impact of tie strength and ego network circles on the diffusion of information in the network. Specifically, there is a high correlation between the frequency of direct contact between users and her friends in Twitter (a proxy for tie strength), and the frequency of retweets made by the users from tweets generated by their friends. We analysed the correlation for each ego network layer identified in Twitter, discovering their role in the diffusion of information. © 2015 Elsevier B.V."",""Ego networks"; Information diffusion; Online social networks;" Tie strength"",""Behavioral research"; Network layers; Structural properties; Ego networks; Future internet; Information diffusion; On-line social networks; Online social networks (OSNs); Personal networks; Social contacts; Tie strengths;" Social networking (online)"",""Arnaboldi, V."; IIT-CNR, Via G.

Modeling the interactions among the heterogeneous users as a graphical evolutionary game, we derive the evolutionary dynamics and the evolutionarily stable states (ESSs) of the diffusion. The different payoffs of the heterogeneous users lead to different diffusion dynamics and ESSs among them, in accordance with the heterogeneity observed in real-world datasets.

The understanding of the social relationship among users is a factor beneficial to various applications like viral marketing and advertising through social networks. The advertisers aim to select initially a small number of information hubs and provide free samples of a new product to influence a large number of people to buy the product in a short time. Estimating the influence of users, discussing different domains like daily charts, movies, celebrities and sports require analysis of short tweets posted to a social network. With this intent, the fundamental motive is to maximize the influence of a social network in a certain domain of interest. This work proposes support of self-centered network on domain specific information hub classification (speed-diffusion) technique with the aim of classifying information hubs in different domains. Speed-diffusion is an unsupervised classification model, where the output is based on the software analysis without using training samples. The speed-diffusion technique integrates the self-centered network and N-gram classification model to classify the domain specific information hubs. Speed-diffusion represents each domain as a self-centered network, automatically built using WordNet and Yago Ontology. Analysis of short tweets posted to a social network quantifies the general influence of each user with respect to the self-centered networks of various categories. The N-gram classifier leverages these short tweets posted by the user depending on how far its words are from the self-centered network to mine the information hubs specific to a domain. Finally, it evaluates the accuracy of the speed-diffusion technique than that of the existing approaches using a sample of the Twitter network. © Medwell Journals, 2016."",""Classification"; India; Influence; Self-centered network and N-gram classification model;" Twitter"",,""Arularasan, A.N.";" Department of Computer Science and Engineering, India"",,""Medwell Journals"",16823915,,,,""English"",""Asian J, Info.

In this paper, a new type of network community in online social networks (OSNs) is identified using the association between network nodes. This new network community is called 'virtual community.' Virtual communities are based on either the real/physical relationships of users that are connected to their constituency, social, and professional activities or their virtual interactions associated with their cognitive levels, choice selection, and ideology. Users belonging to the same virtual community exhibit similar behavior in linking to nodes of common interest. These nodes, which reflect the common interest of a community, are called 'prime nodes.' Prime nodes are linked to the prediction problem in OSN completion and are generally recommended for OSN growth. Recent studies on ranking algorithms have shown that the incompleteness of OSNs contributes to the low accuracy of ranking algorithms in identifying top spreaders. Thus, in this paper, we propose an OSN completion method based on link prediction through association between prime nodes. An experiment on predicting new links in two real big data sets of two global OSNs, namely, Facebook and Twitter, is conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed method is also validated by applying prominent ranking algorithms to the newly predicted and original networks. Results show that the accuracy rates of the ranking algorithms are improved, thereby validating the importance of the proposed method in predicting vital links. © 2016 IEEE."",""Information diffusion"; Link prediction; network community; online social network; prime node; ranking algorithm;" Virtual community"",""Big data"; Forecasting; Online systems; Virtual reality; Websites; Information diffusion; Link prediction; Network communities; On-line social networks; Prime nodes; Ranking algorithm; Virtual community;" Social networking (online)"",""Wahab, A.W.A."; Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology, Malaysia;" email: ainuddin@um.edu.my"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",21693536,,,,""English"",""IEEE Access"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold"",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015168531";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We present several practical strategies and evaluate their performance with a real dataset collected from Twitter during the 2010 UK election campaign. Our experimental results show that information can be efficiently propagated in online social networks using neighbors with a high propagation rate rather than those with a high number of neighbors.

We assume there exist influential users who play important roles in crowd unfollow, and identifying these opinion leaders could be significantly useful for public opinion crisis management. Along this line, we face the following challenges. (1) How to define the coverage of identifying influential users? That is, since the social networks are dynamically evolving, how to determine when to identify influential users? In this paper, we consider the trigger as crowd unfollow event. (2) How to construct the social network for identifying influential users in crowd unfollow? Specifically, starting from the former followers of specific target, we construct an Ex-fan Interaction Network (EFIN) by considering two kinds of links between users, i.e., following and mentioning behaviors.

As a result, the mechanism of information propagation changed deeply, the study of which is indispensable for the sake of understanding the evolution of information networks.

In a disaster context, the passing on of official warning messages by members of the public also serves as a behavioral indicator of message salience, suggesting that particular messages are (or are not) perceived by the public to be both noteworthy and valuable enough to share with others. This study provides the first examination of terse message retransmission of official warning messages in response to a domestic terrorist attack, the Boston Marathon Bombing in 2013. Using messages posted from public officials' Twitter accounts that were active during the period of the Boston Marathon bombing and manhunt, we examine the features of messages that are associated with their retransmission. We focus on message content, style, and structure, as well as the networked relationships of message senders to answer the question: what characteristics of a terse message sent under conditions of imminent threat predict its retransmission among members of the public? We employ a negative binomial model to examine how message characteristics affect message retransmission. We find that, rather than any single effect dominating the process, retransmission of official Tweets during the Boston bombing response was jointly influenced by various message content, style, and sender characteristics. These findings suggest the need for more work that investigates impact of multiple factors on the allocation of attention and on message retransmission during hazard events. © 2015 Sutton et al."",,""Article"; hazard; human; information dissemination; Internet; population risk; public opinion; social media; strategic planning; terrorism; text messaging; vulnerable population; bomb; history; information dissemination; linguistics; Massachusetts; procedures; running; social network; terrorism; Bombs; Boston; History, 21st Century; Humans; Information Dissemination; Psycholinguistics; Running; Social Networking;" Terrorism"",,,""Public Library of Science"",19326203,,POLNC,""26295584"",""English"",""PLoS ONE"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-84942940406";;;;;;;

The results show that Twitter users generated a loosely connected hub-and-spoke network, suggesting that information was likely to be organized by several central users in the network and that these users bridged small communities. On YouTube, homogeneously themed videos formed a dense mesh network, reinforcing shared ideas and meanings. According to the geographic distribution, both Twitter and YouTube networks were actively organized by U.S. users, but the YouTube network was activated mainly by anonymous users. These results highlight differing roles of social media in political information diffusion in which the Twitter network not only organizes and coordinates information but also facilitate the exchange of ideas between different groups. YouTube is suitable for disseminating ideas and reinforcing solidarity among members.

The widely used web applications of online social networks, have many benefits to serve as a medium for fast, widespread information diffusion platforms. While there are substantial works on how to maximize the diffusion of useful information, there are many misinformation diffusing on social networks. How to control the misinformation diffusing efficiently with the smallest cost is still a big challenge. We tackle this challenge by reducing the problem to finding the critical blocks. The critical blocks are the sets of nodes that partition the whole network evenly at a small cost, and we believe they play a key role during the process of diffusion, and the nodes in critical blocks have advantages to span different communities in some social networks too. We prove such problem of finding critical blocks is NP-complete and therefore an exact solution is infeasible to get. A simple but effective solution is proposed by the following steps: first we convert a social network graph into a Laplacian matrix, then we compute its Fiedler Vector, which has been proved to have good properties, with the help of Fiedler Vector, we develop some heuristic algorithms to find critical blocks. We perform lots of experiments both on synthetic data, real world datasets from Twitter and coauthor networks from DBLP, the experimental results show that our algorithm is effective and efficient both on synthetic data and real world data. And we demonstrate a case analysis as an anecdotal evidence to show there do exist critical blocks in social networks and our algorithm can find them effectively and efficiently. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",""Critical blocks"; Fiedler Vector; Information diffusion;" Social networks"",""Heuristic algorithms"; Matrix algebra; Anecdotal evidences; Co-author networks; Critical blocks; Effective solution; Fiedler vectors; Information diffusion; On-line social networks; Real-world datasets;" Social networking (online)"",""Zhang, E."; Computing Center, China;" email: zed@cc.neu.edu.cn"",,""Springer New York LLC"",1386145X,,,,""English"",""World Wide Web"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-84958115908";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

We assume a generic information diffusion model in which time delay associated with the diffusion follows the exponential distribution and the burst is directly reflected to the changes in the time delay parameter of the distribution. The shape of the parameter’s change is approximated by a step function and the problem of detecting the change points and finding the values of the parameter is formulated as an optimization problem of maximizing the likelihood of generating the observed diffusion sequence. Time complexity of the search is almost proportional to the number of observed data points and has been shown to be very efficient. We first demonstrated that the proposed method can detect the burst using a synthetic data and showed that it performs better than one of the representative state-of-the-art methods, confirming that the proposed method covers a wider range of change patterns. Then, we extended our evaluation on synthetic data to show that it is efficient and effective comparing it with a naive exhaustive search and a simple greedy method. We then apply the method to the real Twitter data of the 2011 To-hoku earthquake and tsunami, and reconfirmed its efficiency and effectiveness. Two interesting discoveries are that a burst period detected by the proposed method tends to contain massive homogeneous tweets on a specific topic even if the observed diffusion sequence consists of heterogeneous tweets on various topics, and that assuming the information diffusion path to be a line shape tree can give a good approximation of the maximum likelihood estimator when the actual diffusion path is not known. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York."",""Burst detection"; Change point detection; Information diffusion;" Social networks"",""Maximum likelihood estimation"; Social networking (online); Time delay; Burst detection; Change point detection; Earthquake and tsunamis; Exponential distributions; Information diffusion; Maximum likelihood estimator; State-of-the-art methods; Time delay parameters;" Trees (mathematics)"",""Saito, K.";" School of Administration and Informatics, Japan"",,""Kluwer Academic Publishers"",09259902,,JIISE,,""English"",""J Intell Inform Syst"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925292269";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Millions of users every day log on their Facebook or Twitter accounts to get updates and news, read about their topics of interest, and become exposed to new opportunities and interactions. Although recent studies suggest that the contents users produce will affect the emotions of their readers, we still lack a rigorous understanding of the role and effects of contents sentiment on the dynamics of information diffusion. This work aims at quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion, to understand: (i) whether positive conversations spread faster and/or broader than negative ones (or vice-versa)"; (ii) what kind of emotions are more typical of popular conversations on social media;" and, (iii) what type of sentiment is expressed in conversations characterized by different temporal dynamics. Our findings show that, at the level of contents, negative messages spread faster than positive ones, but positive ones reach larger audiences, suggesting that people are more inclined to share and favorite positive contents, the so-called positive bias. As for the entire conversations, we highlight how different temporal dynamics exhibit different sentiment patterns: for example, positive sentiment builds up for highly-anticipated events, while unexpected events are mainly characterized by negative sentiment. Our contribution represents a step forward to understand how the emotions expressed in short texts correlate with their spreading in online social ecosystems, and may help to craft effective policies and strategies for content generation and diffusion. © Ferrara and Yang."",""Computational social science"; Information diffusion; Sentiment analysis; Social media;" Social networks"",""Dynamics"; Sentiment analysis; Computational social science; Information diffusion; Information production; Negative sentiments; Social ecosystems; Social media; Temporal dynamics; Unexpected events;" Social networking (online)"",""Ferrara, E."; Information Sciences Institute, United States;" email: ferrarae@isi.edu"",,""PeerJ Inc."",23765992,,,,""English"",""PeerJ Comput.

The advent of social media has resulted in this information spreading quicker then ever before, and in qualitatively different ways, since people no longer need to be in face-to-face contact or even know each other to pass on information in an crisis situation. Social media also provides a wealth of data about this information diffusion since much of the communication happening within this platform is publicly viewable. This data trove provides researchers with unique information that can be examined and modeled in order to understand urgent diffusion. A robust model of urgent diffusion on social media would be useful to any stakeholders who are interested in responding to a crisis situation. In this paper, we present two models, grounded in social theory, that provide insight into urgent diffusion dynamics on social networks using agent-based modeling. We then explore data collected from Twitter during four major urgent diffusion events including: (1) the capture of Osama Bin Laden, (2) Hurricane Irene, (3) Hurricane Sandy, and (4) Election Night 2012. We illustrate the diffusion of information during these events using network visualization techniques, showing that there appear to be differences. After that, we fit the agent-based models to the observed empirical data. The results show that the models fit qualitatively similarly, but the diffusion patterns of these events are indeed quite different from each other. ©JASSS"",""Diffusion of Information"; News; Social networks; Twitter;" Urgent diffusion"",,,,""University of Surrey"",14607425,,,,""English"",""JASSS"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926350493";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

As the result of the factor analyses, we extracted 3 factors on user’s action towards spread message which are: 1) Desire to spread the retweet messages as it is considered important, 2) Mark the retweet messages as favorite using Twitter “Favorite” function, and 3) Search for further information about the content of the retweet messages.

As a result, we found that weak links formed through the sharing function play a more important role in maintaining the range of information diffusion and provide more structural advantage in acquiring and controlling information than the strong links formed through the making-relationship function. © The Author(s) 2015."",""Network analysis"; sharing function; SNS network;" weak ties"",""Electric network analysis"; Information management; Component levels; Ego networks; Information diffusion; Social network services; Strong link; Structural advantage; Structural effect; Weak ties;" Social networking (online)"",""Park, J.-H.";" Department of Library and Information Science, 423 Widang Hall, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, South Korea"",,""SAGE Publications Ltd"",01655515,,JISCD,,""English"",""J Inf Sci"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-84930408908";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Based on the assumption that the time evolutions of the topic graphs associated with persistent and non-persistent topics are different, we propose to detect persistent topics by performing anomaly detection on the feature values extracted from the time evolution of the topic graph. For anomaly detection, we use principal component analysis to capture the subspace spanned by normal (non-persistent) topics.

Influence may rise or fall quickly over time and thus capturing this evolution of influence is of benefit to a varied number of application domains such as digital marketing, counter-terrorism or policing. In this paper, we investigate the influence of users in programming communities on Twitter. We propose a new model for capturing both time-invariant influence and also temporal influence. The unified model is a combination of network topological methods and observation of influence-relevant events in the network. We provide an application of Hidden Markov Models (HMM) for capturing this effect on the network. There are many possible combinations of influence factors, hence we required a ground-truth for model configuration. We performed a primary survey of our population users to elicit their views on influential users. The survey allowed us to validate the results of our classifier. We introduce a novel reward-based transformation to the Viterbi path of the observed sequences, which provides an overall ranking for users. Our results show an improvement in ranking accuracy over using solely topology-based methods for the particular area of interest we sampled. Utilizing the evolutionary aspect of the HMM, we attempt to predict future states using current evidence.

How information diffuses over social networks has attracted much attention from both industry and academics. Most of the existing works on information diffusion analysis are based on machine learning methods focusing on social network structure analysis and empirical data mining. However, the network users' decisions, actions, and socio-economic interactions are generally ignored by most of existing works. In this paper, we propose an evolutionary game theoretic framework to model the dynamic information diffusion process in social networks. Specifically, we derive the information diffusion dynamics in complete networks, uniform degree, and nonuniform degree networks, with the highlight of two special networks, the Erdo{double acute}s-Rényi random network and the Barabási-Albert scale-free network. We find that the dynamics of information diffusion over these three kinds of networks are scale-free and all the three dynamics are same with each other when the network scale is sufficiently large. To verify our theoretical analysis, we perform simulations for the information diffusion over synthetic networks and real-world Facebook networks. Moreover, we also conduct an experiment on a Twitter hashtags dataset, which shows that the proposed game theoretic model can well fit and predict the information diffusion over real social networks. © 2014 IEEE."",""Evolutionary game"; game theory; information diffusion; information spreading;" social networks"",""Artificial intelligence"; Computer simulation; Dynamics; Game theory; Learning systems; Dynamic information; Evolutionary dynamics; Evolutionary games; Game-theoretic model; Information diffusion; Information spreading; Scale free networks; Social network structures;" Social networking (online)"",""Jiang, C."; Department of Electronic Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China;" email: chx.jiang@gmail.com"",,""Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc."",1053587X,,ITPRE,,""English"",""IEEE Trans Signal Process"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-84906258306";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

So far, validation of the proposed predictors has been done by simulating the spreading dynamics rather than following real information flow in social networks. Consequently, only model-dependent contradictory results have been achieved so far for the best predictor. Here, we address this issue directly. We search for influential spreaders by following the real spreading dynamics in a wide range of networks. We find that the widely-used degree and PageRank fail in ranking users' influence. We find that the best spreaders are consistently located in the k-core across dissimilar social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Livejournal and scientific publishing in the American Physical Society. Furthermore, when the complete global network structure is unavailable, we find that the sum of the nearest neighbors' degree is a reliable local proxy for user's influence.

A detailed data set about the official content-sharing function on Twitter, called retweet, is collected and the statistical relationships between users' social network characteristics and their retweeting acts are documented. A two-stage consumption-sharing model is then estimated using the conditional maximum likelihood estimatio (MLE) method.

Here, we describe a streaming framework for online detection and clustering of memes in social media, specifically Twitter. A pre-clustering procedure, namely protomeme detection, first isolates atomic tokens of information carried by the tweets. Protomemes are thereafter aggregated, based on multiple similarity measures, to obtain memes as cohesive groups of tweets reflecting actual concepts or topics of discussion. The clustering algorithm takes into account various dimensions of the data and metadata, including natural language, the social network, and the patterns of information diffusion. As a result, our system can build clusters of semantically, structurally, and topically related tweets. The clustering process is based on a variant of Online K-means that incorporates a memory mechanism, used to “forget” old memes and replace them over time with the new ones. The evaluation of our framework is carried out using a dataset of Twitter trending topics. Over a 1-week period, we systematically determined whether our algorithm was able to recover the trending hashtags. We show that the proposed method outperforms baseline algorithms that only use content features, as well as a state-of-the-art event detection method that assumes full knowledge of the underlying follower network. We finally show that our online learning framework is flexible, due to its independence of the adopted clustering algorithm, and best suited to work in a streaming scenario. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien."",,""Cluster analysis"; Media streaming; Social networking (online); Clustering procedure; Clustering process; Content recommendations; Information diffusion; Natural languages; On-line detection; Pervasive applications; Similarity measure;" Clustering algorithms"",""Ferrara, E."; School of Informatics and Computing, United States;" email: ferrarae@indiana.edu"",,""Springer-Verlag Wien"",18695450,,,,""English"",""Soc.

A large number of users participate in these networks and the size of the resulting graphs poses computational challenges. There is a particular demand in identifying the nodes responsible for information flow between communities"; for example, in temporal Twitter networks edges between communities play a key role in propagating spikes of activity when the connectivity between communities is sparse and few edges exist between different clusters of nodes. The new algorithm proposed here is aimed at revealing these key connections by measuring a node’s vicinity to nodes of another community. We look at the nodes which have edges in more than one community and the locality of nodes around them which influence the information received and broadcasted to them. The method relies on independent random walks of a chosen fixed number of steps, originating from nodes with edges in more than one community. For the large networks that we have in mind, existing measures such as betweenness centrality are difficult to compute, even with recent methods that approximate the large number of operations required. We therefore design an algorithm that scales up to the demand of current big data requirements and has the ability to harness parallel processing capabilities. The new algorithm is illustrated on synthetic data, where results can be judged carefully, and also on a real, large scale Twitter activity data, where new insights can be gained. © 2014 Mantzaris;" licensee Springer."",""Betweenness"; Community analysis; Community connectivity; Information diffusion; Social network analysis; Twitter;" Viral content"",""Betweenness"; Community analysis; Community connectivity; Information diffusion; Twitter; Viral content;" Social networking (online)"",""Mantzaris, A.V."; Department of Mathematics and Statistics, 26 Richmond Street, United Kingdom;" email: alexander.mantzaris@strath.ac.uk"",,""SpringerOpen"",21931127,,,,""English"",""EPJ Data Sci."",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Gold, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-84933501670";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Therefore the user influence in social media, such as Twitter, is widely studied based on different standards, such as the number of followers, retweets and so on. However, little work considers the accurate click number of short URLs as the measurement of influence. In Twitter short URLs are frequently included in tweets because of the limitation of characters. And some users may focus more on click number of the URLs instead of the number of followers or retweets. Thus, it is necessary to analyze the factors that impact the click number received by URLs of users. In this paper, we conduct the predictive analyses about the user influence which is measured by the click number of short URLs. We first exploit a wide range of possible features consisting of the sets of user properties, behavior and topics. And then we employ the logistic regression analysis to identify the significant features for predicting the user influence, and find most of features we proposed have a significant predictive power to the user influence.

Specifically, we consider the following set-up: There is a physical information network where information spreads amongst people through conventional communication media (e.g., face-to-face communication, phone calls), and conjoint to this physical network, there are online social networks where information spreads via web sites such as Facebook, Twitter, FriendFeed, YouTube, etc. We quantify the size and the critical threshold of information epidemics in this conjoint social-physical network by assuming that information diffuses according to the SIR epidemic model. One interesting finding is that even if there is no percolation in the individual networks, percolation (i.e., information epidemics) can take place in the conjoint social-physical network. We also show, both analytically and experimentally, that the fraction of individuals who receive an item of information (started from an arbitrary node) is significantly larger in the conjoint social-physical network case, as compared to the case where the networks are disjoint. These findings reveal that conjoining the physical network with online social networks can have a dramatic impact on the speed and scale of information diffusion. © 1983-2012 IEEE."",""Coupled Social Networks"; Information Diffusion; Percolation Theory;" Random Graphs"",""Communication media"; Face-to-face communications; Information diffusion; On-line social networks; Percolation theory; Physical information; Random graphs; Social Networks; Communication; Epidemiology; Information services; Social networking (online); Solvents;" Telecommunication networks"",""CyLab, , Pittsburgh, PA 15213, United States"",,,07338716,,ISACE,,""English"",""IEEE J Sel Areas Commun"",Article,""Final"",""All Open Access, Green"",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878160375";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Previous research has identified several content-related features as well as user and network characteristics that may drive information diffusion. However, little research has focused on the relationship between emotions and information diffusion in a social media setting. In this paper, we examine whether sentiment occurring in social media content is associated with a user's information sharing behavior. We carry out our research in the context of political communication on Twitter. Based on two data sets of more than 165,000 tweets in total, we find that emotionally charged Twitter messages tend to be retweeted more often and more quickly compared to neutral ones. As a practical implication, companies should pay more attention to the analysis of sentiment related to their brands and products in social media communication as well as in designing advertising content that triggers emotions. © 2013 M.E.

In this paper, in spite of most approaches being optimization based, we have addressed the community detection problem (CDP) by a novel framework based on Information Diffusion Model and Shapley Value Concept. Here, each node of the underlying graph is attributed to a rational agent trying to maximize its Shapley Value in the form of information it receives.

We first investigate how geographic distance and interactions between users influence the formation of link structure among users. Then we study how social theories including homophily, social balance, and social status are satisfied over networks with parasocial and reciprocal relationships. The study unveils several interesting phenomena. For example, """" friend 's friend is a friend"""" indeed exists in the reciprocal relationship network, but does not hold in the parasocial relationship network. We propose a learning framework to formulate the problems of predicting reciprocity and triadic closure into a graphical model.We demonstrate that it is possible to accurately infer 90% of reciprocal relationships in a Twitter network. The proposed model also achieves better performance (+20-30% in terms of F1-measure) than several alternative methods for predicting the triadic closure formation.©2013 ACM 1556-4681/2013/07-ART5 $15.00."",""Link prediction"; Predictive model; Reciprocal relationship; Social influence; Social network;" Twitter"",""Forecasting"; Link prediction; Predictive modeling; Reciprocal relationship; Social influence; Twitter;" Social networking (online)"",""Lou, T."; Institute for Interdisciplinary, Information Sciences, Tsinghua UniversityChina;" email: tiancheng.lou@gmail.com"",,""Association for Computing Machinery"",15564681,,,,""English"",""ACM Trans.

With the popularity of microblogs, there are growing data and opportunities in understanding information propagation behaviors in online social networks. Though some influence models had been proposed based on certain assumptions, most of them are based on the simulation approach (not data driven). This paper aims at designing a framework to model, measure, evaluate, and visualize influence propagation in a microblogging social network. Considering how information contents are spread in a social network, we devise two influence propagation models from the views of messages posted and responded. Based on the proposed models, we are able to measure the influence capability of an individual with respect to a user-given topic. Our design of influence measures consider (a) the number of people influenced, (b) the speed of propagation, and (c) the geographic distance of the propagation. To test the effectiveness of our influence model, we further propose a novel evaluation framework that predicts the propagation links and influential nodes in a real-world microblogging social network. Finally, we develop an online visualization system allowing users to explore the information propagation with the functions of displaying propagation structures, influence scores of individuals, timelines, and the geographical information for any user-query terms. © 2012, Springer-Verlag."",""Diffusion models"; Influence analysis; Information propagation;" Social networks"",""Information dissemination"; Search engines; Diffusion model; Geographical information; Influence analysis; Information propagation; Micro-blogging platforms; On-line social networks; Online visualizations; Speed of propagation;" Social networking (online)"",""Lin, S.-D."; Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering, Taiwan;" email: sdlin@csie.ntu.edu.tw"",,""Springer-Verlag Wien"",18695450,,,,""English"",""Soc.

Social media, like Twitter, has been increasingly used for exchanging information, opinions and emotions about events that are happening across the world. Here we propose a novel visualization design, Whisper, for tracing the process of information diffusion in social media in real time. Our design highlights three major characteristics of diffusion processes in social media: the temporal trend, social-spatial extent, and community response of a topic of interest. Such social, spatiotemporal processes are conveyed based on a sunflower metaphor whose seeds are often dispersed far away. In Whisper, we summarize the collective responses of communities on a given topic based on how tweets were retweeted by groups of users, through representing the sentiments extracted from the tweets, and tracing the pathways of retweets on a spatial hierarchical layout. We use an efficient flux line-drawing algorithm to trace multiple pathways so the temporal and spatial patterns can be identified even for a bursty event. A focused diffusion series highlights key roles such as opinion leaders in the diffusion process. We demonstrate how our design facilitates the understanding of when and where a piece of information is dispersed and what are the social responses of the crowd, for large-scale events including political campaigns and natural disasters. Initial feedback from domain experts suggests promising use for todays information consumption and dispersion in the wild. © 1995-2012 IEEE."",""contagion"; information diffusion; Information visualization; microblogging; Social media;" spatiotemporal patterns"",""contagion"; Information diffusion; Information visualization; Microblogging; Social media; Spatiotemporal patterns; Information systems; Diffusion; computer graphics; computer interface; computer program; information dissemination; procedures; spatiotemporal analysis; Computer Graphics; Information Dissemination; Software; Spatio-Temporal Analysis;" User-Computer Interface"",""Cao, N."; Hong Kong University of Science and TechnologyHong Kong;" email: nancao@gmail.com"",,,10772626,,ITVGE,""26357174"",""English"",""IEEE Trans Visual Comput Graphics"",Article,""Final"","""",Scopus,2-s2.0-84867634266";;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Most studies have focused on direct influence, while another interesting question can be raised as whether indirect influence exists between two users who're not directly connected in the network and what affects such influence. In addition, the theory of complex contagion tells us that more spreaders will enhance the indirect influence between two users. The authors' observation of intensity of indirect influence, propagated by n parallel spreaders and quantified by retweeting probability in two Twitter social networks, shows that complex contagion is validated globally but is violated locally. In other words, the retweeting probability increases non-monotonically with some local drops. A quantum cognition based probabilistic model is proposed to account for these local drops.

In this project, we examined the potential influences of business engagement in online word-of-mouth communication on the level of consumers' engagement and investigated the trajectories of a business' online word-of-mouth message diffusion in the Twitter community. We used path analysis to examine 164,478 tweets from 96,725 individual Twitter users with regards to nine brands during a 5-week study period. We operationalized business engagement as the amount of online word-of-mouth messages from brand and the number of consumers the brand follows. We operationalized consumers' engagement as the number of online word-of-mouth messages from consumers both connecting to the brand and having no connection with the brand as well as the number of consumers following the brand. We concluded that the business engagement on Twitter relates directly to consumers' engagement with online word-of-mouth communication. In addition, retweeting, as an explicit way to show consumers' response to business engagement, indicates that the influence only reaches consumers with a second-degree relationship to the brand and that the life cycle of a tweet is generally 1.5 to 4 hours at most.
